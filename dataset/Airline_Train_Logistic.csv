@united for the record- Rozana at Newark was lovely and helpful. #choosekind
@united It was last night's 1235/ORD-LGA.
@united thx for update
@united thank you !
@united dm these nuts
@united Had to explain to a very over eager flight attendant trying to ask about my vision that my @ccicanine was not a guide dog!
@united what's the point of asking for details about a #servicedog when you book if your flight crew doesn't read them? (Continued)
@united I tried but no one was available in bogota and everyone was rude in Houston. I was stuck for 35 hours because of you guys
@united #worst2unitedflightsever UA 236 LAS to IAD 2/24 mechanical problems again - took off - had to land for fix - delayed again #wtfodds!
@united despite my bag not making it to Newark good informative email tracking updates help!

@united #worst2unitedflightsever UA1429 IAD to LAS 2/19 mechanical problems - switched aircraft delayed 3.5 hours!
@united crashed trying to check in.
"@united Wow. What a deal. Again, 30+ plus seats available. Easy change to make a customer happy."
@united thanks for the info I already knew...
@united Airline trouble this winter &amp
@united on 768 to Logan - boarding gong show due to lax carry on enforcement. Bins full of coats = no room for bags. U need a better system!
@united Thank you.
@united Blackmailed me into paying �130 extra or having my return ticket nullified in San Francisco Airport. Terrible service from rep #scam
@united is there an email address I can reach? Too long for a DM.
@united disappointed that u didnt honor my $100 credit given to me for ur mistakes. Taking my business elsewhere  ��Ε�out.
@united ua1673 still waiting! Supposed to depart 9:08
@united it was credit from my last trip that never came in the mail!
@united ok it's now been 7 months waiting to hear from airline. I gave them quite a bit more than the 30 days requested! Terrible service
@united does this process ever end? Still waiting for the reply since 2 months #pathetic #customerservice
@united What's going on with your website? I'm Flight Booking Problems three tickets today and I've been booted off the system umpteen times.
@united how do I get my account number if your website says email is unavailable?
@united So do I need to book two one ways in order for her to fly as an unaccompanied minor?
"@united I received 1 bag last night, I am still missing the other one."
"@united @simonroesner you'll need to upgrade the seats too, even in economy plus it's like sitting on a concrete bench."

"@united bet you wont honour them, like mine ey"
@united 2nd flight also delayed no pilots! But they boarded is so we can just sit here! #scheduling
"@united I guess that's too much ask, huh?"
@united but it's hard to stay upset at someone when they at least TRY to show remorse.
"@united By the way, a simple apology goes a long way, even if it's a hollow one. It's obvious that you don't care about me or my well-being,"
@united This isn't a one time thing either! It's a shocking pattern of repeated neglect and disrespect.
@united Fingers crossed &amp
"@united It's an incredibly easy fix, but you would rather stay in your comfort zone, while I get forced out of mine."
@united ours in July. You have ZERO excuses for this. You have an out-of-date system that causes problems like this.
@united Everyone around us is sitting with their friends and family members. They booked their tickets in October and December. We bought
@united Not sure what you are talking about. She is going on nonstop flights. SNA to SFO and then SFO to EWR.
".@united it will be because I'm moving to @AmericanAir because of @united talk, no service"
@united please be good to me this weekend!
"@united I asked a legitimate question about systemwide vs. localized problems, and got back an unreLate Flightd copy/paste. You can do better."
@united what time? Who can I call. I need my skis. I will go to the airport and get them. No more faith in United.
@united I see you guys are at it again. Amazing how one company continually makes mistakes yet fails to be held accountable for their error
@united A Tourist Wonder: Super Tides and Tide of the Century at French and U.K coasts: http://t.co/gXdqORtsS0
@united Yeah sorry but there's always a problem with United. And you have an international reputation for having problems.
@united yall should probably work on that.
"@united but then again, maybe the @BBBNE_SD_KS_IA would care more to hear what went on than whoever listens to issues you caused"
@united I wonder if sharing all this on FB and insta would produce a number. 140 characters really limits my story telling.
@united so you're telling me there is no number to call after being left in an airport because of a negligent pilot and staff?
@united Could this email be resent as it doesnt appear to have arrived.
@united yes please! Trying to get to POP- in Newark now....
@united you have to follow me in order for me to DM...come on now
"@united $25 United coupon to make up for broken entertainment system on a 9-hour flight, seriously? #Ridiculousness #learncustomerservice"
@united So they didn't drop my bag overnight &amp
@united I did DM the details but still no response. I have to book today.
@united I know this is probably a no but is there a way to get a cheaper airfare ticket if the flight is leaving in a few hours? _٪�
@united can someone please explain the process of of what happens to property found on a plane after passengers leave at Heathrow ?
@united not able to DM you my confirmation number
"@united I've sent the message, let me know if you got it. I'm not very twitter-literate. Also, is he REALLY going to be stuck for 18hrs?"
@united very unhappy at no response to complaint emailed on 2nd Feb ref.8441639. Awful customer service!
@united DM does not work what do I do?
@united private jet would have been cool! Do does not work. I'll try again

@united I'm so frustrated and nervous because of this.
@united are the ones who make it difficult for me.
@united I'm not a child. I'm someone who has an issue with flying and prepares ahead of time to reduce the distress caused by planes. You
@united how does it get Cancelled Flightled 10 hours before take off?
"@united This ALWAYS happens with you guys, and it makes traveling incredibly stressful and uncomfortable. Is that good business to you?"
@united So what does someone with severe anxiety do when the one person who can help him isn't next to him?
@united I'm seeking to go 2 client. B/c u cant get me there I need refund. I filled out form not confident it works if past is an indication
.Thnx for the response @united bot. It seems this 'improvement' could be easily attained. Is your 1st Class service really only worth $50?
"@united has unrivalled access to #California with flights to the U.S. from 7 UK airports, with nonstop or one-stop connections year-round"
"@united booked award tix on ThaiAirways but I'm not seeing a conf# for them, just the United Flight Booking Problems#. Can you get get the Thai# for me?"
@united Luckily I made my flights this time but was so disappointed with the lack of communication :(
@united checking to see why flight 3466 (atl-ord) got Cancelled Flighted?
@united service so far has been horrid. We wanted to end the trip on a high note. Guess that's not an option.
@united Booked a flight home over 7 months ago and requested seats together for my fianc̩e and I. We got 2 middle seats. UNACCEPTABLE. The
@united YOU GUYS ARE HORRIBLE.
@united thnx for the info
@united Why do I have to pay $ 17 for wifi with an international business ticket?  #pennypincher
"@united ok. To top things off, you've lost my luggage. Could you get ANY worse??? #UnitedAirlines"
@united kudos for not Cancelled Flightling flights from DFW this morning.   United usually first to panic...
@united AND my luggage has been broken!! #youcouldntmakethis up #brokenwheel
@united is flight 587 from DFW to ORD currently on-time? I see an advisory that DFW may be affected by weather
@united maybe one day you'll be the one quoted on http://t.co/mJkpgVXmPC
@United flight delayed-no one remembered to turn the heat on flight 559 leaving ORD-seriously???
@united another awesome new plane flight 1584 and extremely nice Captain Steve Connolly.
@united to speak to a real person to get this resolved politely and efficiently. (2/2)
"@united I hadn't filed a refund claim as I was told there was no charge by your DM. This is disputed by my bank, hence why I would like(1/2)"
@united did  bags make it on the flight out of iad? second day without clothes is pretty inconvenient. We're pretty curious #UnitedAirlines
@united Every United flight between Saipan and Guam is an adventure! You never know when @CapeAir's old plane will be operational :)
@united hence why I've been asking for the customer service phone number so I can speak to a real person to get this sorted out
@united did our bags leave Washington yet? That would be convenient seeing as we left there a day ago. #UnitedAirlines #lostluggage
@united so if I'm flying 1st class just one leg to Chicago but not on my long flight to China am I still able to use the lounge in Chicago
"@united according to your DMs, I'm not owed a refund. please may I be provided with a contact number before I go to my bank to file claim"
@united about 3 hours ago. I need to work out if my bag can make it to my hotel here in time or if it will need to go elsewhere.
@united Okay thank you
@united I've filed the claim but have no way of calling for updates. Is there another way to do this?
@united pls properly train your agents. Requested to speak to 1k customer service &amp
@united Thanks for remembering to load my bag onto my connecting flight. Oh wait you forgot. Iceland should be fun with no clothes....
@united Thank you for the cheese platter and abundance of entertainment options. Time just flew by.
"@united customer service is atrocious! You have disrupted my travel plans, you have lost my luggage and it is impossible to TALK TO A HUMAN"
@united terminal at MIA should have food open before 5am esp when there are flights at 6am. Two hours early like recommended. Can't eat.
@united it was UA flight 1001! Now I'm currently stuck in Portland because I missed my ride because of the 3 hour delay. #GetMartyHome
"@united has not responded to my various requests for contact numbers, does anyone know the UK customer service number for #UnitedAirlines"
@united how we looking on getting those bags to Lusaka
@united Could you update me on the suitcase please? The online and phone tracking told me nothing. I was told I'd have it back yesterday!
@united thank you. Been trying for two days to set this up.
@united just 1 last thing. U guys shouldn't be charging $ for drinks on a transatlantic flight
@united LHR arrival lounge #fail. Waited 20 mins for shower then left to find hotel. U know how many passengers u carry. Planning???
@united Any luck with finalizing my reservation? I DM'd information to you. Please let me know what else you need. Want to confirm ASAP. Thx
@united completed form but doubt it's any use. UA doesn't care. 6 day vacation will now be 5. Sure UA won't feel responsibility for that...
@united Definitely a compliment! I really thought my bag was lost after it was sent on to another airport. In the end I am a happy customer
@united thanx so much. You followed through and emailed me a $1000 ticket voucher. #unitedairlines they do care
"@united this will definitely be a trip to remember EWR-STI second of the season, first on seat 35A because it pays to be loyal!"
"@united nope, they told us it was time for them to go home and to sleep at the airport. Even though they assured us we would get a room..."
@united keep me updated. Let me know that the bags make the flight to j-burg
"@united ..back for the expensive holiday, he worked all year to pay for, that you RUINED! We want compensation &amp; his original case back!"
@united thanks United I understand that. But he would actually like his own bag back! What have you done with it?! He also wants the money..
"@united frankly worse customer service ever. Problems will happen, how you deal defines a company. Never again United."
"@united It's still a valid flight. Just seems strange to delay for Late Flight inbound crew,  7 hours from now, when the plane is already here."
@united Thanks for the lack of help and the canned response from the 1K desk!
@united   It's too bad UA has had another unforeseeable operational issue on my return flight.
@united I would like to know what's going on before his current flight lands.
@united if I pay you $25 and $35 for my luggage to be delivered when I arrive. Why should I have to wait 3 additional days for its delivery?
@united so 8 hotels for 32 people but feel like we are being held hostage because someone has our boarding passes so we can't leave! #FAIL
@united you are one great airline ��_��
@united Outbound 2 bags 70 lbs bags Returning home 1 bag 50 lbs. What is your logic? And WHY? Am I writing to a Machine? Human HELP required
@lindaSWC @united:  We don't like to hear you had a poor experience. Please share details w/our Customer Care team http://t.co/HIsc4NdMgZ.
@united no Cancelled Flightn just left us to fend for ourselves when flt came in Late Flight. Getting runaround for 3 hrs. Each employee blaming  previous 1.
@united This is NOT a local UNITED number for Malaysia   0011 800-55558000. What is your local United Airlines here in Kuala Lumpur ( KUL )?
@united okay ase24766m. Find our luggage.
@united The agent that met us at the gate said any issues w/delays on UA1116 would have to be taken up online...
"@united I send you an urgent message via eservice@united.com.  BG0KWM   Narayanan. Please respond ASAP. Also, NO local United Tel # @ KUL"
@united thanks! Will you guys be getting the A380s anytime soon?
@united But they are not... lady one phone says its in tel aviv. Tel Aviv united says its in Newark. No one knows and I have nothing...
���@united: @MelanieSpring We'll see what we can do. ^KN�۝ We are running! Most of this plane is running. Thanks for the help!
"@united yes, but still now answers. Many have not had their luggage for 3 days! Unacceptable!!"
@united what is that going to do for you? Nothing just like you always do
@united I sent in my feedback.  Thank you.
@united plus what about food? And taxis?
@united you are offering us 8 rooms for 32 people #FAIL
@united 32 people getting pretty tired about no action on solving the problem plus missing a day of vacation and skiing
@united The bright side would be keeping the promise that was made to me. Hope you're having a good night. Thanks.
@united yes I do.
@united I take back the comment about your team here working hard to help us A so far no solution for a hotel or food or anything #fail
@united on 4124 arriving two hours Late Flight into CLT. Now sitting on the tarmac while they move a plane from the gate. Unhappy customer.
@united airlines is the absolute worst. They have no idea what they are doing. #neveragain #UnitedAirlines
"@united Thanks; might want to fix this line: ""Our Customer Care team is currently responding to most inquiries within 7-10 business days."""
@united we just flew with United from AUS (Austin Bergstrom) to Cancun Intl. Best flight ever! The 737's are not too big... Not too small!
"@united it's frustrating, as a frequent flyer, loyal since Continental. Upgrade equals paying 3 times or more on top of purchase ticket."
@united Deep Vein thrombosis
"@united at its worse. Can't figure how to pack plane, screws up connectns then claims no hotl rooms in San Fran for stranded pax. Way to go!"
@united 4 passengers after a 2 hour delayed flight left with no hotel at the end of the night @ hou airport. Wtf??!! http://t.co/ZfqMpGXVS6
"Hey @united why does the flight from IAH to POS leave so Late Flight, and the one back to IAH so early? I rather get to POS earlier"
@united Lost bag process is broken. Agent promised they'd call &amp
@united the people at the counter have been very helpful. As you can see nobody is there. Flight to Austin 10:55 and still sitting here.
@united unfortunately still on the Tarmac at @fly2ohare and definitely missing my ride from @flypdx #GonnaBeALongNight
���@united: @Darquenloveli We regret to hear this. Please let us know if you need assistance. ^KN�۝ I was finally able to secure my seat. Thx
@united what time does check in open for flight no UA80 from Manchester to Newark today ?
"@united good to know you will open the closed doors for ""premier passengers"" after safety briefings on delayed flights. #annoyed."
@united DM sent
@united yea get me to phoenix already. Delays all day with you people. It's bullshit.
"@united If it's any consolation, your staff was stellar. Just not the hour+ delays I encountered with every one of my 4 flights."
"@united flight ua3576, gate b1. And tell ray I somehow made it on to the 736 flight out of IAH and didn't have to wait for the 917 one. :)"
@united that's unfortunate. The @Tumitravel was an xmas gift and it looks like a razor ripped right through the front pocket in the picture
@united But thanks for asking
@united Lost bags. Cancelled Flightled flights. Delhi call centers. Poor United staff spread thin and stressed. You name it.
@united Yes. Doesn't make that mistake any less absurd. Doesn't change the fact that I'm very inconveniently missing my luggage tonight.
@united I'm constantly having challenges with upgrades &amp
"@united In ORD, waited 20 min after crew members left before gate items came. Flight attendant sarcastically said good luck and walked away."
"@united Follow me back, please, and I'll happily DM you the link because I'd rather not share my travel plans publicly."
@united you too!
@united is my favorite airline.
@united seriously #fail on making strangers share a room
@united @luke_mcintosh68 nah you wouldn't
@united we needed them here asap. Will they make it on today's flight?
@united agent split up my reservation? Now can't Cancelled Flight and refund credit for 2wks? Why
@united Our vacation's going to be ruined w/ 3 days of rain. : ( The change fee for 2 of us is nearly cost of original flight. Can you help?
@united I sent the message. Let me know ASAP.
@united why would they make me share a room?
"@united tried calling too, but w/25 min phn wait means we'd miss options anyway"
@united can you ask your guys with flight 1146 to BWI to wait for us to get off a delayed flight from San Diego? Pretty please?
@united we're still waiting to find out your rep is working hard - most upset about having to wait to tomorrow pm to get to mammoth
"@united for an early flt, I think a call is appropriate. Yes, reviewed and nada avail until next day. Expect full refund"
"@united i understand, thanks"
"@united again I ask, who can I call to get this fixed? Tweeting me BS questions to stall only makes things worse. Phone number please."
@united Yo yo yo stuck on the tarmac for over 2 hours at @fly2ohare ... Going to miss my ride at @flypdx help please! #HelpImStuck #United
@united it's highly unprofessional for you to overbook a flight by 12 seats &amp
"@united well, considering every agent before claimed they were unable to help with everything else, why waste more time to hear 'call corp'"
@united man I can't wait to book my ticket now! Thanks JP you're a life sabe
"@united Ice, which I totally understand. But when a large number of us are facing 15+ hours of time and overnight Cancelled Flightations it seems like"

"@united tag numbers 0016 964012, 0016 964077, 0016 964078 - let's find these bags."
"@united better train your support staff with appropriate decorum, consider revisiting your terrible ""provide a death certificate' policy"
@united Well the bar is set low! You guys are really good at the apology game! What will change? When will u guys learn?
"@united My post was just more of disappointment.  I'm a frequent United flyer, it was a simple ??.  1 bad apple doesn't spoil the bunch."
@united you guys continue to impress me in Houston. http://t.co/cIh1qNllcM
@United I have no way of making phones calls... Need to handle via Twitter/email/web. Thank you!

@united thanks for effing up our holidays - we're missing a full day of skiing due to your baggage team's incompetence at @FlyYOW
@united Twitter isn't letting me DM you..
@united I hope so too
@united agent helps the person in front of me.  Finishes up with them and then walks away.  The guy behind me is as shocked as I am.
@united Connection at ORD was on the exact same plane again. Checked carry-on was apparently taken off &amp
@united Not encouraged that I'll have my CPAP tonight.
@united Yes. Did file a claim as soon as the carousel stopped without my bag on it. Got an email that its found but not sched for delivery
@United an idea: monitor mileage members travel patterns enough to know when they change jobs/lose status...and make the transition easier.
@united  Delay DEN-CLE because they have to manually enter baggage tags? Really? Worst cust service day for this 1ker. #friendlyskies??
"@united Why tell us flight is delayed, then tell us it's on time again with 20 min to spare? Don't say it's delayed unless you're sure!"
"@united yes in Lusaka, Zambia. My guess is the bags never made the plane at IAD."
@united where is my flight voucher?
"@united Late Flight to Denver, Late Flight to Newark...let's not even get into the disaster that was checking bags. Unacceptable."
@united has once again let me down. Don't think I've ever flown with them and not had problems. Worst airline period.
@united yes I filed a claim &amp
@united UA938 ORD-LHR.  bags are being loaded 30min Late Flight. Frigid air into cabin! Plane feels like falling apart! Upgrade long haul fleet!
"@united Flight attendant never served me my beverage (tea), and not once checked up on me. What gives? #ua6076 #notcool"

@united I received my luggage that also looked to be left in the snow when I arrived. I'm asking for all 50 people to be refunded.
@united updated A320 aircraft has wifi and device entertainment but no outlets. I don't get it. How can I charge devices?
@united was no one between the scan and inside the plane. I just asked the people in line around me where the plane was going
"@united 5 gate changes, two delays.  Even the crew thinks the airline sucks"
@united I'm very frustrated and have wasted 2 days now due to your equipment failures.
@united computers are down but you stopped giving updates and took my flight info off the app. That's just ridiculous keep people updated!
"@united Soooo, it's been 15 days and you've offered no response. So I assume poor treatment by gate agents is the norm now?"
@united Terrific. Many thanks. Looking forward to being back on UA tomorrow. Had a great flight up to Vancouver.
@united Calls to 800# resulted in 2hrs of hold time &amp
"@united It's taken ~3 weeks for Cust Care to respond to Case #8477733, requesting a refund for wi-fi not working. Where can I get an update?"
@united I appreciate your efforts getting me home!
@united That's correct���I've spent hours trying to book online only to receive an error when clicking final purchase button. (1/2)
@united Today was not your finest. All could have been prevented by one gate agent advising 200 passengers.
@united  what is the real deal with the delay on flight UA 1032 from Denver to Vegas?
@united UA63 from Madrid arrived no agent mass confusion we sent to and fro by 3 UA employees. MaryJo was rude and unhelpful.
@united system failure again = bad trend.  Software projects are like flying an airplane

@United THANK U! Secured room for the night Thx to VERY helpful customer service rep N. Dorns.. I thanked her.. Can u 2? #goodenoughmother
@united where's my damn bag??
@united well someone should tell that to the employees at the Denver baggage claim. Still no bag!!!!
@united Greetings. UA Club member here. Any idea if I can use the Air Canada Lounge at YVR. Flying UA tomorrow.
@united how is Mexico not international from the us?
@united diverted and missed our connecting flight. Was just told that my bag is on it's way to MSY. If you only had people that cared
@united Male agnt in LAS threatens Canadian cust when cust takes pic of him at gate after agents announce can't help rebook. #friendlyskies?
@united @Apollochplayers we just want to go home tonight - why did you Cancelled Flight the last leg of our reserv. w/out our permission??! #PH6RPS
@united  Stressed and rude agents. Overwhelmed by delyd flight LAS-DEN 1657. Yelling at several people. Not pretty. This is #friendlyskies??
@united landed in Boston at 9 last night.  The 15 hours of traveling was rough tho.
@united FAIL You Cancelled Flightled our flight frm GJT and then used our reserv home to IAH (from SEA) for reFlight Booking Problems w/out OUR PERMISSION!! #PH6RPS
Just sent thank u RT @united: @goodenufmother Please DM your confirmation number if reFlight Booking Problems is needed. Thank you. ^EY
@united has made my no fly list. Other airlines wait when connector Late Flight. Stuck in IAH.
@United so what�۪s the deal? Do u provide voucher for overnight or am I cozy on the floor at #OHare ? #gross #HelpMePlease #AnyoneThere
"@united also, the mere fact that I have to go online to issue a statement vice calling and talking to some directly is one good example."
@united thank you. I flew into Newark from Vail/Eagle.
@united  i have a weekend of dealing with your company that would say otherwise.
@United now what?!? http://t.co/5hpSqVRjK8 flight was gone when I got off plane! #BusinessTravel #goodenoughmother
"@united the proper response: sorry for your wait, what flight # were you on so we can look into the issue. That's how @Delta would handle."
@united your customer service is terrible! Stood inline 3 hours no flights and 4 hours Late Flightr still no bag#disgutedindenver
@united please upload the March on-demand entertainment listing on your website! ����
@united So you are inadequate by accident?
@united @reebok @rockinwellness @ Denver International Airport https://t.co/tKVmHBkeC3
@united Thank you for responding so quickly with a helpful tool! @dustyob
@united boarding time shows 35 min and your gate agent started at 45. showed up at 4:00 and they had to check bag. http://t.co/zCBJyo6lsN
@united Agent in LAS letting 20 customers know they can't help them rebook delayed flight to DEN #unfriendlyskies http://t.co/QuzVmK2rTR
@united empathizes w/ my disappointment that 1stClass flight w/nonworking entertainmnt is worth $50. #UnFriendlySkies http://t.co/lOecO4gmvd
@united ...and when that doesn't work...
"@united did you have seen my message today?? About a mcdonnell Douglas dc 10 model?? I will hear it if you read it, Goodnight now"
@united searched for mileage tickets to BOM couldn't find a single one is saver awards - I see how you play.  Earn miles but can't use them.
"@united flight arrives 30 minutes early, but then have we to wait for an hour for our bags."
@united That's not the issue. The fact that no one even called (despite promises) to confirm the bag's location is.
@united what's a girl gotta do to get a flight name change when SHE bought one for a mean ex boyfriend and needs a girl's trip stat?!
@united thank you. We are signed up for notifications. We shall watch and wait! ������
@united still waiting to hear back. My wallet was stolen from one of your planes so would appreciate a resolution here
@united I would love if someone could get me back to Austin tonight and I do not wish to wait til tomorrow morning.
@united or @flysaa has lost my baggage��_ heard different things from different employees of @united. @flysaa has said nothing.
"@united cs thinks that miles can repair the damage done, it will be interesting if they travel in @united and exp the worst flight ever!"
@united I have a 0530 flight out of DFW on Tuesday. How far in advance will you give notice if Cancelled Flightled?
@united I am signed up for notifications. This is the first trip I was not updated on. Not sure why this happened.
@united Thank you. Took care of everything and made it right. That's the experience I'm used to. Opened the app to find flight changed.
@united that is not in line with your responses here. And now I'm waiting until tomorrow morning because all the flights are overbooked.
"@united I took the exact same aircraft in to LAX 3 days ago. It fit, no problem. The agent today told some nonsense about a policy change"
@united your helpful agents in Club helped.  I am just out baggage fees and a night of my life.stop doing business with @SilverAirways
@United never heard of this? http://t.co/QDebyaHqfM
"@SouthwestAir doesn't charge ticket change fees. Do they not incur the same mysterious ""costs"" that you incur, @united?"
@united Exhausted &amp
@united I was denied getting on the plane w/o getting the chance to prove it fits. I'm not a rookie. Read my bio.
@united that's exactly the point. It fits. I'm premier access. Boarding group 2. This was a return ticket. I've been doing this for 15 yrs
@united I've never experienced worst customer service. Placing blame on codeshare partners and not assuming responsibility is unacceptable
@united currently on board so not now. Check in was terrible. Staff rude. Expensive luggage thrown around etc.
"@United fucked up, then voided my ticket, and KEPT MY MONEY.  Not even an apology. I will never fly with your airline again. #UnitedAirlines"
@united has the WORST customer svcs! This Kevin rep at call center must be investigated. My baggage's lost and there's no help but argument!
@united should NOT sell tickets for @SilverAirways on http://t.co/onhXHCO6bK.  has terrible service and UA staff cannot reach Silver
"@united Just got demoted from Gold cuz my hubby got 100% of the PQD, tho there were enuf $ spent for 4 Golds.#spousal.discrimination/angry."
@united Thank you!
@united When will direct flights from Belfast Intl to Newark resume from their winter break? Thanks.
@united My favorite way to travel! Thank you! http://t.co/vGN2X1ckg0
"@united yes, after this awful weather it appears I can get home"
@united yes lots. You have terrible customer service at Newark and despite raising a complaint there we were ignored hence the tweet
@united Lovely new plane from LGA to ORD but no power outlets?
"@united but if i tweet the ID number, won't that reveal my home address to anyone on the web?"
@united I filed a delayed bag report on Saturday! my flight was Cancelled Flightled and I never went anywhere!
@united the person is currently bettween gates 71A and 73 in LAX
@united i need it there before she lands so she can have the EWR baggage claim file to have it sent but the employee has not droppeditoffyet
"@united rarely ceases to amaze...for the worse.  i hope this is the last time i ""have"" to fly with you."
@united thank you for the quick response but I cannot dm you until you follow me as well
@united iCloud it is not there yet -- PLEASE HELP 917 703 1472
"@united I need the phone number to baggage claim in LAX, my mom left her phone and someone called saying they would put it there but on"
@united I did... no response back
@united this is atrocious customer service.
"@United will not have to honor absurdly low mistake fares.

@united #albanyairport delayed departure to check bags at gate claiming space filled and walk on to open spaces a delay #poorcustomerservice
@united you Cancelled Flighted our flights for no reason &amp
@united @dfpietra THAT'S your response?  Shaking my head back and forth with a tsk. You can do better-from customer service to your apology
"@united thanks! It's 35K miles from RTB to Europe, to do a multiple destination so we could stop over in US on way/way back- mileage diff?"
@united of course I did. The bag should be here by now :( #frustrated
@united you are the worst. I will avoid you like the plague.
@united is the worst airline in the world.
@united someone needs to DM me and resolve this correctly. Extremely disappointed with the service I received. Terrible management.
@united Premier Gold desk changes flight. Waives fees. Gives me wrong flight. Now Jana Acosta in Salt Lake refuses the same service. Angry.
"@united I will give you one thing, you are consistent but unfortunately you are consistent at not doing your job well #AlwaysDelayedOnUnited"
@united I will but right now I'm to angry
@united first time flying with United. Also last time. #terrible back to @VirginAtlantic for me. #branson #virginatlantic #UnitedAirlines
@united I used to be a committed #ContinentalAirlines flyer until merger. I remember now why I switched to @SouthwestAir #CommunicationFail
@united the least you could do is offer me a ticket in coach instead of just Cancelled Flighting my reservation because of your glitch!!! #notfair
"@united I'm saying I made the flight but with poor/non-communication, unaccounted for lost time &amp; lots of frustrated flyers standing around"
@united I think DM would be better
@United gate announcement states delay due to maintenance yet app says Late Flight arriving aircraft  tell the truth! @unfriendly
@united you are easily the worst company I have ever experienced. You have lost someone's personal possessions &amp
@united how can your app show arriving aircraft is early but departing flight is delayed due to Late Flight arriving aircraft? @unfriendly
@united already did that at the airport and 12 hrs Late Flightr its still not here! you guys are really killing me today. trying to stay positive..
@united once united's service levels reaches those of Etihad or lets be more realistically Lufthansa then ill consider it again
@united really?  Someone called in sick and then someone FORGOT to call a replacement?!  Now an hour Late Flight to take off. #theworst
@united Asked Flight attendant what typical compensation would be &amp
@united done
"@united Thank you, ^JH, appreciate the prompt responses--me and other passengers will be doing so."
@united has been such a disappointment today. Simply put. Rather unpleased with things currently. Flight delayed
"@united During the same round trip, my NON-English speaking friend was stranded TWICE for 12+ hours each time! Most staff members were rude."
"@united  found a group of people who actually hates people more than ISIS, thats right United Airlines."
"@united Nope. Walked up &amp; down the ORF terminal, &amp; not a United agent to be found. Showed up @ last minute to board us. Many panicked people"
@united thank you
@united by the time I finally get to Dallas I could have driven with less frustration and cheaper.
"@united I'm trying to get to my final destination, we need compensation. Just about 2hrs of personal time wasted."
@united that guy really has no customer service clue.Could have spent effort clearing bins for rollerboards instead of art projects in mine!
@united he has no priority and Iove it
@united Pleased to be a Premier Platinum
@united how can you not put my bag on plane to Seattle. Flight 1212. Waiting  in line to talk to someone about my bag. Status should matter.
"@united @campilley hahaha. If they weren't an American company, i would say this was great sarcasm!!"
@united i think he actually did not like your screen  @campilley _���_���_���
@united Apparently they are asking 20 people to off board the plane--how can such a big miscalculation be made?!
@united It's a shame choosing #United may be the difference between reuniting with aging friends and never seeing them again #PoorService
"@united hi guys, do you have a general enquires email address please? Thanks David."
@united Just checking in again - what is the status of our claim.   It is going on 2 months with no attention to this?   We are very upset.
@united my flight was delayed due to maintenance in LIT and caused me to miss my connection at IAH to MSY. Can you help?
@united #UnitedAirlines Pls Fix #AspenBaggageFail issues. Had to pay my own way to #Aspen after flight Cancelled Flight. Left us in the cold in DEN.
@united Read my bio. See who I work with. I have NEVER encountered this with your airline before. Disappointed is an understatement.
@united Does customer care have email or a phone rep that I can speak with? We had so many issues they can't be placed in 2000 characters?
Thank you ���@united: @TRUU_Tall I can certainly take a look. Please follow and DM me your confirmation number for assistance. ^JH�۝
@united In the process of recovering their car rental - condo rental $ in Florida. They called #United for an alternate flight #NOANSWER
"@united I am buying 2 yo own seat on 3 legs of intl trip, car seat? Required? If not- then allowed? Can child still sit w/mom after takeoff?"
@united thanks for listening! I definitely was not the only person in line who thought it was absurd.
@United We've been waiting on tarmac for &gt
"@united Thank you. Mention that before I boarded she asked 1other person to measure their bag, and it was another woman. Men not asked."
@united Can't leave the Tarmac ..united's gate agent cannot agree on a head count. 20 min now counting a 100 people max #epicfailunited
@united That's real dedication &amp
@United blocked me from DM'ing them because they would rather I complain about them in a public forum
@united ok. I just submitted. Thanks for the opportunity to give feedback.
@united Big thanks to Ms. Winston for assisting me over the phone with a baggage claim issue today. She really went the extra mile!
"@united I will, as soon as I am done with my article.  Thanks!  ~Tom"
@united booked flights for 2 for $779. Was charged $389.50 twice. Means I can't redeem CC points properly. Would have gone elsewhere.
@united We've had a ton of problems with getting our bags and have been given the run around for a day. Whats up with that?
@united pedophile airline. Split myself and my 10 yr old daughter rows apart on flight 1254 to boston
@united have been waiting 2 days for my military bags from an airport 3 hours away from me. Horrible.
"@united Arriving 25 minutes early is nice, but not if equipment isn't ready. Waiting 30 minutes for luggage, so far. Time gains wiped out."
@united is doing musicians real dirty at LAX. I've never been blocked from getting on a flight with my bass.
"@united I'm rebooked now, but the line was 300 people deep."
.@united For those playing along at home: http://t.co/2b4bDTldX2
"@united @FlyEIA yes, they said it took more than an hour!"
@united those whose pay to actually fly with you over 30k/ year deserve better service than a CC holder.
@united Ok thank again for your help!
@united Not a happy flyer.  UA flight 1161 from SFO to Cleveland.  Sunday 2/22.  Stay tuned for blog article from http://t.co/VdFdODqVGx
Thanks @united. @imran_r44 had a question about the wait time for baggage on UA6366
@united flight 1491...plane from SFO to DEN is basically on time.
@united thanks. Just a program comment
@united 20 min more delays to flt 2086 at sfo 2 load 2 more pax makes no sense. Will strand many of us overnight at ORD due to missed cnxns
"@united Heads up We didn't check 8 bags, 2 we checked arrived, those aren't claim #s for our 2. Other people's bags? http://t.co/dplQ3mhQGD"
"@united This must be a drone ���@united: @KeamBleam We understand your frustration. Our Bag team is working hard to get your bag(s) to you..."""
"@united Change made in just over 3 hours. For something that should have taken seconds online, I am not thrilled. Loved the agent, though."
@united flight attendant doesn�۪t understand not understanding English doesn�۪t mean they are deaf. Stop yelling English slowly to them.
"@united Not appropriate to ask in public (hence the dm). each united employee, each a new answer. your process was such a hassle i Cancelled Flighted."
@united well that's big of you but I don't have terribly high expectations at this point.
@united it's like you're trying to make me hate your airline. Fee for each checked bag that's never mentioned in the ticket + rude agents _���
"@united nice your app says US 4972 delayed by weather.  Pilot says waiting on fuel.  One in ur control, one not"
@united Please than Robin at EWR Premiere Desk for helping me get on a an earlier flight. She did the work.  Huge thanks.
"@united Ok thank you, do you provide complimentary hotel accommodations since I'll have to stay overnight?"
@united I was originally trying to share details but the link Jimmy Samartzis Vice President - Customer Experience sent me expired.
"@united really? 3 hr delay, 4 gate changes, &amp; you boarded us, sent us back up, &amp; boarded us again.  Won't change our flight. Can we go now?"
"@united that would help! or how about integrate it into the App so I can just ""activate"" it and surf..."
@united I did. The AC went on for about 20 minutes before returning to the Mojave Desert. #PressureCooker #HeatTrap
@united Nope - still no one helped me.  Giving up on united. #badservice
"@united 8602947, jon at http://t.co/58tuTgli0D, thanks."
@united when an airline causes the missed connection u would think they would take whatever steps to remedy that screw up.
@united I'd thank you - but you didn't help.  taking 6 hours to reply (so I get a message in the middle of the night) isn't actually helpful
@united Flight UA1270 is descending into farce and we haven't left EWR yet. Is this going to get any worse?
"@united I was told it was due to be on UA23 which flies direct to Dublin, so why did it go to London? This is a complete shambles!"
@united 45+ min at EWR baggage claim #stillnobags #ridiculous
Flight Booking Problems for a travel writers trip I am hosting and need to be happy when I land! Do you have the cute PJs AA does? @united
But I don't see AA @united
@united Did you find out where it is? Thanks
"@united On a standby to Denver, which has been delayed, and a confirmed to Aspen, whose flights have been Cancelled Flighted all day. 0 confidence."
@united yes at 2am...but now back on a plane again and delayed again due to baggage loading issue... http://t.co/NfAQHhr09j
@united at what pt do u just Cancelled Flight!  Finally got stndby 4 1pm flight. What a day!  #missedWork #clientNotHappy http://t.co/sUPrLfOi8T
@united thank YOU for your kindness. Your agents went above &amp
@united don't see a justifiable cost to get on an early flight with seats. No airline charges to conveniently get their passengers in early
@united Woke up to notification- flight moved 1.5 hrs early. Barely made flight then 3 hrs layover in SFO - wanted to hop on earlier option
"@united I will do delayed baggage claim when I land. Hopefully the bag isn't broken into, damaged or lost w/c will result in more complaints"
"@united done. Want me to send a screen shot of the second call, which is now at over 45 minutes?"
@united look at this beauty _��� dc 10 united airlines _��� http://t.co/MvYoizRPdE
@united Thanks! I'll fill up the form as soon as I land. I don't like being duped so I hope you will appreciate my feedback &amp
"@united, this is the line in Denver to rebook due to weather issues. DO BETTER. http://t.co/tmccExYaaQ"
"@United the ones who suffer. I understand delays, I don't understand trying speed up a process that has been delays to this extent."
"@united 2 Cancelled Flighted flights Late Flightr, agent claimed she put me on a new flight but then Cancelled Flighted it. Coworker got on flight- now delayed. Now?"
"@United of urgency, but this is ridiculous. Your ceo claims to be customer focused, yet when delays happen, planes sit and customers are"
@united I wasn't asking for a full refund but delaying me 3 hours and giving no reason should be enough to give partial credit
"@United flight was scheduled for 11:56, it's 1:05 and we haven't moved. I have never been on a flight where everyone moved without a sense"
@united ok thx!
@united I can't DM you so here's the confirmation # G8CVWJ - please is there any way I can make it to Kailua tonight? Thank you
@united go to hell
"@united since bulkhead seats cannot have bags on floor, why don't u reserve o/head space above those seats? In 1B on UA246 - not impressed"
@united Definitely will!
@united Would be helpful if you could refresh boarding time info on boarding passes for delayed flights
"@united  18 flights so far this year. 13 delays including 2 Cancelled Flightations.  Late Flightst reason, crew needed mandatory sleep. IN MEXICO!"
@united great to hear Thankyou so much. Greatly appreciate your replies. Feel much more settled now.
@united counter agents at RDU deserve a medal. #thankyou
The saga of the @MelissaAFrancis bag delay w/ @United - will there be a reunion or will she be forced to go shopping? Stay tuned.
@united Flight 211/ORD gate agent tried to prevent me from taking onboard a bag I've used for 15 years! Flight crew was more reasonable!
@united thank you. Literally called for preboarding as I ran up.
@united why do you guys split up the charges to credit cards? Making it unnecessarily more expensive for people to fly with you guys on pts
"@united it was UA381 on 14 Feb. Point is, overselling flights= bad. Making people wait 1hr while you kick them off after boarding is worse"
@united that's brilliant Thankyou so much. Is it classed as part of carryon?
@united what gate is ua5396 leaving from?
@united thank you for listening to my compliant and doing the right thing. I appreciate you working with me
@united we've been here since 3am and you've Cancelled Flightled our flight twice
@united no chance I wait in ORD all afternoon for another flight after you screwed me. Hold 5396
@united UA5396 can wait for me. I'm on the ground trying to get to the gate after we were moved to B. This is crap.
@united from MEX NRT (dates TBD) but I'm getting a 200 to 300 USD difference in my quotations through September when compared to MEX BKK
@united fails again. @SouthwestAir saves the day.
@united better just keep connection from ORD To FWA that boards in ten minutes open until I get off the plane that just landed an hour Late Flight
@united is there a United gold number? I've been on hold 24 minutes and think I may be lost in nowhereland. Have a gold reservation. Help.
@united Great! I'm ready to go home.

@united. It's not my first time flying to the US. I have medical info. Looking for practical like my adapted seat cushion allowed on?
@united noooooooooooooooooooooope.
"@united Oh, we are sure it's not planned, but it occurs absolutely consistently, it's usually the only YYJ flight that's Cancelled Flightled daily."
@united @JMS2802 : outsource it all United Airlines...your customers  are just loving you for it. Outsource. Outsource. Outsource.
"@united Hi, Im flying SFO-LAX-SAL-CLO. My connecting time in LAX is 1h45m. Is it enough time? Do I have to collect my bag and recheck on AV?"
@united Thank you! You need to follow back tho otherwise I can't DM you. X
"@united it's not getting any better. I'd suggest you get a senior manager to this gate , then retrain these gate people"
"@United States faundation was by faith Judeo Cristian,@Not it was by ideologias.@ http://t.co/mWBk68k0A3"
@united @JMS2802 : nothing like supporting your own mechanics and maintenance workers...instead United puts out a video of TIMCO doing wifi.
@united Just sent! Thanks :)
@united already missed  connection ugh
"@united @JMS2802 : sure show a video of your outsourced favorite TIMCO, who has a knack for doing substandard maintenance work on aircraft."
@united How do I formally complain about your customer service handler who misconnected me. I was denied boarding &amp
@united there are a lot of unhappy cold people on the bridge in freezing temps for an hour. Not given any info.
@united flight 3763 IAd-Sat. We're on the outdoor track for an hour
@united - SERIOUSLY it's 2015?!?!  NO WiFi on a 5hr flight from CLE-SFO #1589.  You're the ONLY airline w/out WiFi...and pls no 'unwind' BS.
@united u would not be able to rebook me to get home any sooner than a now 2hr delayed flight.  #linesforever #customerservice #fail #again
@united you're the reason this whole travel experience has been a nightmare
@united what a pointless tweet. At least @AmericanAir asked me to follow them to try and resolve
@united that's not even an apology
@united that's cool - now what?
@united - SERIOUSLY it's 2015?!?!  NO WiFi on a 5hr flight from CLE-SFO #1589.  You're the ONLY airline without WiFi...
"@united, b4 boarding this attendant took his shoe &amp;sock off at the desk and showed other agents his foot. So gross. http://t.co/755VpYm4Mv"
@United are you able to see if there are seats open on another flight??
@united #unitedairlines so is it 6:20 pm or 12:20?   ORD ABQ 3709.   I can't even take a walk without missing a change.
"@united Hopefully my baggage fees will be waived tomorrow when I actually get on a flight, as well as compensation for my hotel room"
"@united Either is fine. However, plundering my hard-earned dollars is not fine."
@united @retailbagholder hahaha. At least they gave u a refund.
"@united your SFO-YYJ fight is Cancelled Flightled several times each week, why even bother?"
"@united, and now while waiting for new pilot the door on plane BROKE. why am I global services status  on an airline that's unsafe? STUNNING"
@united How do I get reimbursed for hotel and taxis for the Cancelled Flightation?
"@united Awesome flight crew on UA1589, re the plane,  the  Jurassic period called and they want their dinosaur/plane back!"

"@united
You really know how to piss people off. Your Farelock option is fake!"
"@united, last week shanghai to sfo 858 delay 5hrs bc of engine. today sfo-sea delay to ""sick pilot"". no compensation. They Do. Not. Care."
@united only thing confusing me is why I lost priority boarding? I'm a mileage plus card member _���
@united We're hoping to hear from you actually.
"@united shes been rescheduled for today, but with the frigid cold, being a possible reason for ""maintenance"" it could be the same issue 2day"
"@united It's the fact that an international should not be with out her bag and no sense of what's going on other than ""maintenance""."
"@united b) I contacted you directly, and the phone service was Laissez Faire at best.  The problem isn't a Cancelled Flightled a flight."
"@united a) she's an international. Her phone is on the fritz, I had to get to Chicago from nearly 4 hrs away to figure everything out."
"@united sorry for the delayed response. It was UA #381 Chicago to San Fran. Held up for almost an hour on the Tarmac. Also, lost my bags"
@united Okay thanks if you could please update me. I was told at the airport someone would call me today but they haven't.
@united thank you very much for the help. We're do I pick up my bags aspen airport &amp

"@united Now arriving a day and a half Late Flightr than supposed to. Lesson of the day, don't believe verbal or written confirmations from United"
@united BUT you have received confirmation via email that you are confirmed and ticketed on this flight.
@united Arriving at the airport 2 hours before departure time and still missing your flight bc you actually don't have an electronic ticket
@united 1.75 hour delay.  Nothing says sorry like a voucher.  Missing time with family.  #family #precioustime
"@united After speaking to a United customer service rep the night before a flight, confirming that everything is ok with your reservation.."
@United has two whole people trying to schedule a flight's worth of missed connections. Shameful http://t.co/6kqLhVaP7G

@united arrived in YYZ to take our flight to Taiwan. Reservation missing our ticket numbers. Slow agent Sukhdeep caused us to miss our flt.
@united thank you!
@united Thanks for the update.
@united and those three people were awesome working very long hours. It is easy to say sorry on Twitter but you should help your ppl @EWR
@united I guess. But what is the excuse for understaffed costumer services? 3 people had to deal with lots of angry passengers. Weather too?
"@united ,now you have Cancelled Flightled my wife and daughter's flt?? What's going on? Follow me so I can dm details."
@united Has it departed? I was awaiting an inbound plane yesterday for three hours and it never arrived. Had to stay overnight (again).
@united #UnitedAirlines Any other way ORD to ABQ anytime within the next 7 hours?
@united just confirmed a seat! Crisis averted! Beers won't be missed now
@united was that English? I'll DM though I don't think you'll make a plane appear.
@united looks like today will be my 6th consecutive delayed flight from you...do I win a prize??? @Southwest Air why don't you fly to SBA? _��_
@united sitting in a plane with no pilot.  Thanks! #waitingonapilot #denver #siouxfalls #whyairtravelsucks
@united Understood and thanks! I should have tried reaching out sooner.
@united already done that. the answer i got was... oops we can give you miles and we're very sorry. but who pays for my discomfort for 9 h?
@united received hotel but no food.  Also email for 3750 miles.  Last trip had 3 hr delay and 5000 miles - so less for Cancelled Flightlation?
@united Do we know why UA5282 is delayed x2)? This is getting crazy. I've already had 2 overnight delays. #UnitedAirlines
@united follow back and I'll give you the details.
"@united and most frustratingly, all this delay happened either at the gate, or even onboard the aircraft! No heads up in advance!!!"
@united The DEN b44 agent (9:30am) was amazing. The MPAgent at check in? She sucks. @seanMFmadden @PeterStraubMMA @jmercadoMMA @TonySimsMMA
"@united my UA3426 on 2/19 was also delayed by 2 hours, stretching my trip way past the midnight, extremely exhausting!"
@united Ha��_ you rebooked me in to an 11 hr layover &amp
@united switched to fly united from delta for the past two trips and was very disappointed. Now my UA4646 on 2/23 is delayed by 3 hours!!
@united traveling with @MegZezzo who is injured. Gate agent in Chicago was awesome helping her. TY #roadwarrior
@united  #UnitedAirlines  how long will1531 be delayed.
@united Why isn't the flight status updated to delayed UA1532 no board
@united I paid for economy plus and you put me in the last boarding group so I have to gate check my bags too? @VirginAmerica knows better..
@united i travelled from SCL- IHA feb 17. the AC on my sit (21L) was ON all night. I complaint to FA who never gave me a real answer. Help!
@united you suck.    9 hour delay?!
@united you are the worst airline in the world! From your crap website to your worthless app to your Late Flight flight. You SUCK! Just shut down.
"@united @scotthroth scott, need a good book suggestion?"
"@united JH, thanks so much for reaching out. I was able to get assistance after waiting for 70 minutes."
@united 3866 is at a stand still! No pilot or paperwork for fix over 25mins! Problem was fixed 30mins ago. Flight is as is delayed!
@united please see dm!!
@united. Is it reasonable to wait 45 mins for the bag you made me check because the flight staff couldn't police the overhead bins?
@united Please msg me a # for customer service. I will have an invoice for my dry cleaning but won't be able take wet clothes to the airport
@united AN HOUR DELAY BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PRINT A PIECE OF PAPER!
@united still no response??
@united 4 people MCI to DEL. Preferably with Jet Airways EWR-BRU-DEL segment. Anytime in December
@united should have been able to get seat assign without paying $174 more - cust sec should have done that for me
"@united There is no ""reference number."" Your agent told me to ""just drive to the airport"" because ""I can't reach anyone there to deliver..."""
@united Slightly better. Crew spent a long time searching for better altitude. Would have helped to let pax in on why all the sharp drops.
@united My credit card was charged on the transaction when I was told it would not be. If the charge goes through I will be contacting you.
@united my PQMs and PQDs are no longer showing up correctly in my MileagePlus acct. How can I get this fixed?
@united Thanks!
@united 768 SFO to BOS and no internet it is 2015 what gives?
"@united is the worst. Worst reservation policies. Worst costumer service. Worst worst worst. Congrats, @Delta you're not that bad!"
@united I am trying to make/change reservations and getting extremely frustrated!!! Giving up and trying another airline!!!
"@united I got email update but still no ETA. More communication/details, apology + info on compensation rights would go a long way"
@united Late Flight crew into #btv last nite delayed todays flt. Will miss connection to #cun. Why do I have to play for hotel tonight in #ewr?
@united no they aren't - I just called to check. #WORSTCUSTOMERSERVICE
@united passengers should have been rerouted to match the intended arrival time (even if you have to incur cost to put us in other airlines)
"@united been solved,  they finally picked up the second time I called,  thanks for the response JH!  7:21 to dulles works!"
"@united need to work on your #United #flierfriendly program. At the very least, clue in your flight attendants."
@united space. Doctors' notes and everything. And on my first trip they lost my first suitcase. Among other issues- not pleased with #united
@united 's new #flierfriendly is garbage. Just had to cry to get attendant to find a place for my medical supplies with limited overhead
@united. epic fail. @reagan. no jetway. been here 15 mins on tarmac!
@united at the gate! IAD to RDU
"@united thanks for the link, now finally arrived in Brussels, 9 h after schedule..."

@united Flight 683 last night was #bad4business. Will be a long time before I recommend United to anyone.
"@united Beyond frustrated  Sked change = no seats, earlier departure and double layover.  Of course only seats are $$++.  Cust svc no help"
"@united working with Lisa J at ORD. she's working hard for us, but this is still VERY disappointing. was on 634 to EWR."
@united love the new 1st class breakfast!
@united i emailed the customer care via the website form. After a long wait Rachelle resolved my issue. But I'm still irritated w/ united.
"@united flight Cancelled Flightled,  and the updated one gets me into BWI too Late Flight! I'd be fine with DCA or IAD,  just arriving earlier!  Help!"
@united so is the ^JJ standing for Just Joking?  I am not finding the humor.
@united Left item n the seatback on UA1260. Is there any way to call DCA to ask if they have the item? Already submitted lost &amp
@united at this point I made it home on my own.
@united I DM'd child's birthdate and full name.
@united Thanks for looking into this and for getting back to me via DM. Glad to hear my bag is finally being delivered to me. Thanks again!
"@united I would like to talk to a customer service agent about the service / non service I received on my last flight a a week or so a go.
J"
"@united you Cancelled Flight my flight. I wait in line to get rebooked, when I'm at the front you make me go to another gate and I lose my place."
@united it wasn't a comment. It was a question. But thanks for your copy and paste response
@united Lisa J is amazing the guy not so much.
"@united you failed me last week at IAH. Next intl trip on Delta. Small ual flight from lax booked, that's it!"
@united We were supposed to board at 605. They just brought the plane from the hanger! WTF did they not know there was a flight?1153 Lax-EWR
@united flew from sdf to ATL to Tampa on Delta. Left early. Arrived early. Crew helpful. Wifi worked!!
@united two years old.  Birthdate 11/13/2012
@united how about starting without the robotic response?
@united I already did.
"@united You can't control turbulence, but you can control customer experience, lot of scared people up here."
"@united Currently on UA862, 20 minutes of the worst turbulence I've ever experienced, and ZERO communication from the flight deck."
"@united yes, but it's not looking. The ticket agent at out terminal dismissed us and we missed a chance at a Miami flight then to DR"
@united I have been told twice my issue has been resolved and twice it has not been. And when I write an email it bounces?! #worstservice
@united flight 433 lets go you look like clowns no one is giving up 1st class for $500
@united what would it cost
@united I'm on hold for the 4th time waiting for you to resolve and issue with a flight for my 6-year-old son. #terribleservice #NoService

"@united No, thanks. I'm sick of your company's lousy excuse for customer service. I'm never flying United again."
@united current hold time AFTER speaking to rep to have tix reissued is 42 mins - why so long &amp
@united I understand ppl make mistakes but don't code something in a way that we can't get reimbursed when it's YOUR fault. Just blatant LIE
@united also forgot add our bag is probably going to just sit in New Jersey because of a missed connection.
@united jx4s2t if you can out today would be great it's our honeymoon and this delay you has put a damper on iy
.@united Not what's been shared by the pilot with passengers!
@united WHERE IS MY RECEIPT! I upgraded return leg and 6 months Late Flightr still NO receipt! http://t.co/DAjWzhLVyu
@United how is it that I book a flight with a reserved seat and then go to check in and find out I have no seat?  WTF.
"@united they're not, actually. gate agent was so rude. now standing in a line waiting for reFlight Booking Problems. missed the only flight to STI. awful."
@united I'm not sure you can do anything as this has been building up over time! Other than promises from your CEO service has gotten worse!
@united wi-fi on 737-800 (aircraft 3511) didn't work entire ORD-DCA flight this morning
"@united Cancelled Flightled my direct flight Newark-Brussels last night, now 7 hours behind schedule. In EU compensation would be a given, but in US?"

@united please help http://t.co/t5mRj5Yw6I
@united Making sure your flights aren't delayed due to poor maintenance would be a start.
@united hilarious
@united hahahahaha ya tried that already
@united WHy is my KTN not showing on my boarding?  Why is TSA pre-check not applying to my boarding pass?
"@United ""Your bag may or may not be at the airport. Unfortunately, no one at the airport is picking up the phone or responding to messages."""
@united funny I paid to check my bag and now flight 1086 is BEGGING folks to check bags for free 1 hour before flight. #notcool
"@united nope not here. You need a little red stamp from the counter. Check yourself, before you wreck yourself son http://t.co/0pRGySvuRm"
"@united wasn't trying to Cancelled Flight, just trying to change my award ticket, same date and place, but thanks for sending the link, I know the fee"
@united unhappy with your new mileage rules :( - was my main reason to keep flying united. Will have to take my business elsewhere
@united I need assistance. Due to your incompetence I need to reschedule a connection. I will NEVER fly @United again.
"@united you've been officially displaced by @DeltaAssist for better flight experience, pleasant cabin crew and timeliness. UA 1m switching!"
@united sitting in the middle for the first time .. Hope it works out well
@united you need a bag bouncer. Get it together
@united and learn how to book flights. http://t.co/MHHS9RUpLv
@united @ShowExpert what is going on with United's Mileage Program? You pay $500 for a ticket and get a fraction of that as PQD credit?
"@united you need to retrain your flight attendants. Saying there is no more room for carry ons when there actually is, is not cool."
UA3388 @united was Cancelled Flightled not delayed.  Re-Flight Booking Problems still 90 miles from home.  At least acknowledge the Cancelled Flightlation.
@united never ever again will I be Flight Booking Problems a flight with United or any affiliate if there is a chance to get on a United flight
@united Was able to send the DM. All good now.
@united three delayed flights and missed connections on first class flights and not get any compensation for losing those seats...
@united and after being on hold for an hour the day before to sort it out and being told it's fine it should be fine when you arrive to fly
@united - it's been almost 2 weeks and still no word from DOT on update of london fare to us cities? any updates on your end?
@united Thanks. Got it straightend out last night.
@united well for a start it would be nice if your ticket was actually in the system when you change a flight
@united any chance flight 3745 is being delayed??  nervous about driving to DFW in this weather to drop off my brother
@united Another awful experience and Victoria at the check in desk in STL could not have been more rude and condescending.
@united no they did not want to deliver at my house. Had to go to sombrons else house
@united have Michelle at T1 ORD train your other staff on how to treat customers. A refreshing pleasure to deal with.
"@united I guess you have to ""follow"" me in order for me to send you a DM.. I tried and it won't send."
@united Will definitely do so. Sending a DM now.
"@united Stopped flying @united 1 yr ago bc of aggressive policy on carryon @bdl listening to pssngrs forced to chk@preboard,#notcomingback"
@united I have sent a message with a bag tag. Have you looked?
@united - Group 2 line gets longer every week. Almost no one left for Groups 3-5 anymore. Time to make Explorer Card Group 3?
"@united just sent you a message on Facebook, how do I follow up a complaint re. Missing clothing out of checked baggage?"
"@united why do I check in online if I still have to wait in line for an hour to ""check in"" at counter? #fuckinlame  @naia_miaa"
@united very poor customer service. I WILL think again befor Flight Booking Problems another United flight.
@united an over booked flight to start with and a red eye from lax to bos with no reclining seat.... #lastflightwithyouever
@united hi -- @united was. Thank you!
@united an efficient layout at kiosks/bag drop lines would help as there is no definition to space. Additional friendly and helpful staff
"@united - 75% of a plane's passengers boarding in your ""Premier"" groups might be an indication of a broken process."
@united Any news about the departure of the flight UA51?
@united EWR agent Barbara was FABULOUS and an example of CUST. SERV. A pleasure talking to you_��_ http://t.co/KMQuLY9g5E
"@united Cancelled Flightled a flight cause the crew needed sleep.But it's totally okay to wake me up at 3am just to let me know it's Cancelled Flightled, again."
"@united changed my last name for my MileagePlus acct on the site in an hour. @BA_USA had me on hold for 20mins, then 5 days &amp; no change yet"
"@united flight landed 13 hours ago, 2 more flights CMH-IAD last night and still no bag..could have driven it from CMH"
@united someone should send a note to the revenue management team and ask about all the open BF and GF seats on 919.
@united Do you have a further update on the suitcase today please.
@united literally sucks
@united thanks for the upgrade today great way to start my week! Cc: @CiscoJimFrench @cobedien
@united Maybe be hiring your own ground staff at LAX when multiple gate agents tell you your baggage is loaded you expect it to be. HOPELESS
"@united basically, I need to leave from Hawaii Late Flight evening (midnight) and get back to Philly Late Flight Monday night. Most trips get me in Tues"
@united I would encourage you to re-interview the sole flight attendant on UAL 6166 from BUF to ORD. Blatantly not stable. Uncomfortable.
@united this is the second time my flights been Cancelled Flightled... Like really?
@united really 1st flt frm IAD 2 IAH is - Late Flight &amp
@united yes please. Going to drive the 6 hours.
@united I am impressed with your super-fast reply to @CGJase

"@united First complaint filed on Feb 11th, over 10 days now and still no response....disappointed but not surprised...."
@united Morning! 4603 has been delayed by 7 hours. Can you get me to Newark for my 10am meeting?
@united please stop spending mktg $ on branding ads. Use savings to improve #cxp. 1hr wait for luggage due to short staff is unacceptable
@united the child is two years old
@united it's 430am and wife still doesn't have her luggage which was promised by 8pm and said to be on its way File number: DCA48810M #Fail
@united was trying to change a flight online but got an error can you help via DM?
@united followed you and DM'd you
@united the staff was rather efficient and got us solutions just freaked me out a little being in limbo in the air.
@united you are terrible.
@united  @DENAirport United 787 in snowy Denver. http://t.co/w1AaKJumXA
"@united I'm glad you didn't mean to, but it doesn't excuse your inefficiency! Only took 70min for the bags, we were your only arrival flight"
@united I attempted to book a ticket 3 times and kept getting a 'error' message. I hope you didn't still charge me.
@united ��_ But friendly efficient air attendants in coach #UA992 http://t.co/49pV3KcHNR
"@united Coach interior on UA 992 looked like it was salvaged from the 80s. Tiny unusable video, no power &amp; lifevests on the floor #UA992 ��_"
@united Now about two dozen back in line to see a single CSR for reFlight Booking Problems final leg. (Kiosks on fritz.)
@united on plane to Newark now. I was checked in as Rebecca Levi. My bag is under her name too.
@united can you help me add my KTN to this reservation PLZ?
@united aaaand 7 hours Late Flightr won't be catching a flight til 6AM...stuck in at airport in a snowstorm with no hotel-how's that for patience?
@united whats UA 1205 lax - newark ??
@united @DelonGerry ual sucks
@united not happening.  Delta took care of us.  Peace!
BUT @united just re-booked to BOS
@united you have now lost my bag. Never ever flying United again #joke
"@united appreciate it, but changing time by 10 min multiple times 6 hours before flight is just annoying and seems like you have 0 clue"
"@united Missed UA1568 connection due 2 mechanical failure UA1543 (""uplink prob""). I will lose ~$400 in clients Mon. How can you compensate?"
@united you'll be hearing from me for sure.
@United so you jacked out my cousins trip to Portland and then Cancelled Flightled her return trip?! No more United
"@united Yes I did.  We headed out to de-ice 5 minutes after I sent it to you.  Made it to Austin, but am now waiting for the luggage."
@united In Ethiopia adopting a child.  Need flight home from ADD to GRR Late Flight 2/27 or very early 2/28. (need to change existing reservation)
"@united after a Cancelled Flighted flight, and 2 delays, you lost my luggage AGAIN! You're the WORST! Disgraceful! Awful company, horrible service!"
@united doesn't help the 100 or more passengers that just arrived an hour Late Flight.
@united 40 minutes on tarmac now. That's after 9 hour delay.
@united I am very glad I took care of own rescheduling now that UA 1580 from OGG was Cancelled Flightled. http://t.co/H3k3oWOhD1
@united Tried filling out the status match form and got hit with an error message. How can I tell if it went through? http://t.co/JbDkxd6eFz
@united Is flight 746 going to sit on the tarmac FOREVER?????????
@united One of your workers refused to give me her name as a reference for my notes. Her tone &amp
@united that's why I blame your company. Because it had every opportunity to do a job and managed to fail each time for just lazy reasons
@united I wanna be grand staff
"@united SF crew lack a lot of customer service, LAX employees are a lot better. Wonder why..."
@united that's why I missed my flight. If the flight had been held for 5 minutes I would have made it. I watched it pull away from the gate
@united also didn't ice the frozen metal walkway. Wasted 40 minutes because no one knew how to do simple jobs.
@united your ground crew was inept and left a truck sitting on the Tarmac. Didn't have a gate agent once we got a gate.
@united I wanna be ride United airline! I love airplane
"@united after 2 days - 1 flight Cancelled Flightled, another delay for 8 hours- united gave me a $7 food voucher. That's how much they value my time??"
@united checked me in through security under the wrong name and given the wrong boarding pass. #AirlineSecurity
"@united what the hell? Flight 746. Delayed since 3 pm, finally boarded and now sitting on the tarmac? Is this f&amp;&amp;%$cking plane Ever leaving?"
"@united Actually, the flight was just Cancelled Flightled! http://t.co/Qf0Oc2HqeZ"
"@united I am a loyal Premier Platinum member, but the lack of communication was really bad. Also, i don�۪t see that it has taken off yet"
@united thanks for having changed me. Managed to arrive with only 8 hours of delay and exhausted
"@united This is the 2nd time I was rebooked (w/delays), and for reasons unreLate Flightd to weather. How do I go about requesting a flight voucher?"
"@united If you consider 50 mins for bags @ 10:00pm on a Sunday night ""as fast as they can"", you should reconsider what you think that means."
"@united It's the horrible attitude from staff after , not just the delay. Not the level of service or respect one expects from United"
@united why do you want me to be loyal  if don't let me carry on my bag that easily fits in overhead
"@united UA flight 1247. SFO to LAX took my carry on at gate. I'm Group 2, overhead bins are empty"
@united On top of that I paid for 1st class and my wife got stuck in coach.
@united Ph the pat answers are BS. After I was denied boarding it sat at the gate until 9:05! Your employees totally suck.
"@United Over the last week, United has provided me with the worst customer service experience of my life. Disgusting. #united"
@united 24 hrs since flight landed and ZERO info on my missing bag? rough ETA would be hugely helpful + restore some confidence
@united big surprise #nogate waiting for our plane. Same fucken issues everything I fly you. #fail #worstairlineever
"@united Not to belabor my point,but shouldn't I be able to put a laptop bag above my seat?  Why is it announced to leave it for rollers? Thx"
@united maybemange the airline alittlebetter. Arrived at LAX and no GATE! #howisthatpossible always the same thing w/u
@united I just checked my united app and the most valuable use of this app has been removed. I can no longer see the status of my equipment?
"@united even after running to gate from your connecting flight, your customer service not let us in the plane that was just parked. Stranded"
@united I'm desperately trying to understand how my girlfriend is being treated with this Cancelled Flightled/delayed flight.  #unacceptable #ORD
"@united Nope, no more chances. Your airline messed up both ways of our trip."
@united Why announce it is for rollers at all? If I want to put a coat in there isn't that my choice?  How about all gate checked? Thx
@united you're my early frontrunner for best airline! #oscars2016
"@united  bags left behind because plane overweight, be great if knew as soon as we landed, instead letting us wait 45 minutes with no info."
@united You are a F&amp
@united was a sponsor of the oscars? No wonder it was a half hour delayed. #Oscars
@united Worked like a charm. Bag was waiting on the carousel when we got to baggage claim. #welldone #goodflight #friendlysky
@united will lose my bag but won't give me free pretzels #frauds
"@united you are trying to charge me 150 bucks because you lowered your award tickets and I want to get my hard earn points back, total BS"
@united does asap mean two hours worth of delay and a return to the terminal to count the luggage a third time? #gottogetbetter
@united Apart from being on hold for over 2 hours and having talked to 5 people and the problem still not resolved!
"@united typical caned response from UA, fix your crappy performing, last placed/ranked airline in this century!"
@united is it even legal for you guys to advertise flights that you cant honor??
@united customer service is the WORST. hanging up on customers intentionally after one hour on hold.
@united was forced  to book a flight on a different date than originally planned for a higher price $1130 felt like a bait and switch tactic
"@united love how you don't give a shit about people who tried to be loyal, but you screw them every way till Sunday. Glad I've stayed away"
"@united tried a different flight IAH-MNL 4/1/15-4/17/15, 6 flights are advertised for $1038 but are not bookable (due to partner error)."
@united it will be on a different airline.
@united and was told that its been the case for weeks but is still not resolved.
"@united clicked ""upgrade now"" and it didn't upgrade. What gives? http://t.co/N7oSjz8a59"
@united you advertise the flight and its still on you website and still can't be book. spent over 2 hours with united support
@united tried to book a flight IAH-MNL departing 3/31/15 returning 4/17/15 you are advertising 9 flights for $1051 that can't be book!
@united I just booked a flight for (2). When I view my reservation it has MI connected to First name. Is this a problem? can it be changed?
@united quick (serious) question - any resources/ratings showing the quality of service is better than 8th place? http://t.co/deWIthPeW2
@united How do I get through @TSA to finally board UA 1534?
"@united yes I have and I was calling in regards to speaking to someone about it even further, but unfortunately i was just bounced around."
@united Flight 472 from ORD couldn't let me know about this? Found out via app minutes before landing. Awful flight. http://t.co/DQJl8vZ2h2
@united i need help but in spanish
"@united A very disappointing experience - plane mech. delay and next one didn't wait. No sincere apology, just told me to complain online"
@united I lost my sunglasses on the flight from OKC to IAH this morning (8am takeoff) .. is there any way to retrieve them?
@united @reccewife with the exception of everything you've asked for. Heh
@united UA1731 - Denver to Austin...  Still on the ground...
@united either your staff or whoever you contract with at PVD is failing you big time tonight...
@united UA1469. Just landed.
@united considering it. Currently gold on @delta. Why should I make the jump for an upcoming flight from SFO to Singapore?
@united flight 435
"@united worst flights I've ever had. ground crew ignored our plane, made me miss flight and now I have to cover the cost of a hotel. #DEN"
@united customers aren't dumb. These revenue based programs will hurt everyone. Not gonna save money like you think
@united it was me who had the problem won flight ua 1580. I called and rebooked myself found my own hotel and taxi
@united will do. Thanks for the help. Cheers
"@united bull crap.  I spent $600 on a recent trip.  That's not small change. I got 10,000 AA miles.  Would have only been 6600 UA"
@united yes I did. Terrible service from your courrier
@united compensate us for new clothes bet you won't
@united I have 8 flights with you in the next two weeks :) let's make some good memories!
"@united, we're stuck at OGG, looks like flight will be Cancelled Flightled. Can you help? =)"
@united yea they been booked on 10 next avalible flights since sat 7am. And when time comes no plane 2nd day of work missed #hotelliving
@united currently crying... I wanted to ski tomorrow but prolly not. Just a boy tryna fulfill his dreams
"@united I tried the online tracking and they said something like ""attempting to locate luggage"""
@united your worker told us not to call because we'd be talking to someone in Thailand...
@united - Going on 3 days (tomorrow) and I still haven't received my bag from my flight to Toronto. Would love to see some seriousness here.
@united is there nothing you can do for me? No compensation at all? Given the circumstances I feel like there must be something you can do
@united there is a disconnect between your PR group and the actual business strategy and employee attitude on the ground.  #liars #united
@united here we go again. 2 of 3 segments SFO--New York RT were delayed OVER 2 hrs each! Why do you suck so BAD!?!Maybe another line of bus?
@united you really screwed up dealing mechanical failure from Maui to San Francisco. Poor communication bad help in getting connections
"@united if you don't like delayed bags, why do you let it happen so much?"
@united the delay is due to customer service for 20 people?  What about the DIS-SERVICE you provided for 100+?  #FlightFail #Hour20Delay
@united he is so excellent and so reliable :) #happycustomer
@united but again UNITED DOESNT GIVE 2 SHITS ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS
@united its funny how none of ur tweets back are helpful what I want is to read 'ya we'll change that so our customers get better service'
@united She is travelling from Melbourne (Australia ) to Bogota (Colombia) tomorrow
@united Hi.  My relative's Flight Booking Problems number is MY8YB4.  Her name is Clarita Jaramillo Mejia.  Thank you
@united it was delivered! Thank you for making sure it arrived at my doorstep!
"@united really needs to get its act together. Really disappointed in our change of flight, delayed flights, etc."
"@united-rebooked to OMA - 180 miles from my destination. Spotty customer service. I get staff stressors but come on, this is your business."
@united Why have airlines always told us they can't open a cabin door once it has been closed?  This plane has done it 3 times tonight.
���@united: Looking for a reason to travel? #quote http://t.co/GGuIg3t28z�۝
@united I can't find any Late Flight evening flights. Are there other airports that would have an overnight flight?
@united Thanks for the vague canned response that doesn't address the issue!
@united thank you!
@united that's not good enough for all of us affected by the awful organization and timing and have now been set back
@united  Otis in the baggage claim by Bay #8. not at all happy but not nearly as pissed.
@united Why is my time less important to you?  #StrandUsInDenver #HourAndTenMinuteDelay #FlightFail
@united airlines: you kidding? Bagage lost this morning from ny to Washington and still no trace? #badservice
@united I did. It took about an hour and a half though
@united Why have you never held a plane for me? #HourDelay #MultipleDoorOpeningAndClosing #DangerOfGettingSnowedIn
@united i did but i got nothing from it. Just dissapointment =(
@united WHERE IS MY FUCKING BAG?!?! Where the fuck is my fucking bag??? TELL ME NOW OR GIVE ME A NUMBER TO CALL A HUMAN. SAN68059M
@united I was sincerely thanking the pilot of flight 4461 of braving the snow and getting me home amongst many other Cancelled Flightlations.
@united Made@it to the gate at 8:23 and they wouldn't let us on. http://t.co/xAToxBnsFa
@united time to give up my 1K status and switch to @Delta - you are so terrible I can't even describe.
"@united Thanks! LOL! #UA6259 will wait for us. Per @flightaware, same tail number as #UA5525 :)"
@united You suck. Flight delayed equipment probs again. Miss connection by 2 minutes and you won't let us on even though it's at the gate.
@United #1758 now going in 40 min waiting for other plane to vacate gate. #findanothergate
@united Flight 2 is 2:30 hrs delayed so far b/c of Late Flight crew. Now we are literally waiting while they have dinner acc. to honest gate agent.
@United many people on Ua6318 are going to miss connections due to long wait time in SFO tarmac. Seriously u can't find an empty gate?
@united You're trying to solve problem of your own making. Charging for checked luggage forces checking at gate. Brilliant.
@united we've been waiting 45 min for a gate at SFO... Yet so many of them are free.  Your excellence in operational efficiency is showing
"@United ""delayed due to customer service"" Huh? http://t.co/XlTV5z6sT1"
@united what about the poor customer service at checkin at Kansas KCI?!? That's it???
@united except all of that delayed the flight anyway.
@United maybe find a different gate #ua1758
@united I sent a message. It's very irresponsible that my suitcase cannot be found. This is truly worst service ever... #fedup #disastrous
@United landed in den on time stuck waiting for gate for 30 min. Maybe an update would be a good idea capt?
@united wanted to point out that not one United crew has been sympathetic. Questions unanswered. MileagePlus is starting to look like a joke
@united can we get an explanation on why UA978 from Ṣo Paulo to Houston has been delayed? Now we're hearing from crew about Cancelled Flightlations.
@united Why was flight 1180 EWR to MCO Cancelled Flightled for tomorrow and what do I do to rebook. Asking for a relative.
@united Can you tell me Jet Airways award availability?
"@united I understand the intent was not to inconvenience, but catching a cab back to the airport to show them wet clothes wasn't an option."
@united What are the chances of my flight to EWR from PIT being Cancelled Flighted tomorrow?
@united @baftz rcvd promo if i booked flight silver status would be extended it was not dont have flier that was sent didnt think id need
"@united, wife landed in DC 5hrs ago. luggage did not, was told it would B delivered/Hotel by 8pm. It's now 10pm, no luggage. #UA484"
@united on a flight at 11:30 tomorrow.
@united not sure why the people in row 7 that paid for a premium seat can't use their overhead space... http://t.co/i9s86KiHge
@united is so cheap they couldn't afford to run the AC on #UA1510. They took pressure cooker to a new level. #Cheap #WorstAirline
@united why is it that Sundays when my husband travels to Chicago he's stuck at Tarmac &amp
@united Well I can tell you that your customer service at RDU airport is horrific but is exception at O'Hare in Chicago.
@united sitting on UAL 683 - a comedy of errors.  UAL is incompetent
"@united on #UA3785 tonight and told delayed due to Late Flight crew. No idea where crew coming from, your staff ++unhelpful. Any ideas?"
"@united, take a look at status of 683, sitting at ORD ... This ain't cool, yo."
@united bummer but thank you for the quick response
@united I didn't have time to take my wet clothes/suit back to the airport and wasn't going to pay for another cab to do so.
@united didn't realize my bag/ contents were wet until I got to my hotel. Sent my suit/shirts out to be dry cleaned. Mtgs start tomorrow.
"@united You load our plane at ORD knowing pilots are 2 hrs Late Flight, then discover plane needs to be fueled? #WTF #united #incompetent"
@united resolved and im sick and tired of waiting on you. I want my refund and I'd like to speak to someone about it.
@united I'm really glad I just waited on the phone for over an hour to be sent to a voicemail. Your customer service sucks. Nothing has been
"@united, you just caused a riot on the airplane. Never seen anything like this"
"@united Instead of sending inaccurate emails about delay every 5 min, just say we will get you there when we get you there."
@united so glad I've been waiting for 1 hour and 15 minutes and Ive been transferred 3 times without resolving anything. Worst service ever.
@united we still need help. Hung up on twice. Customer service rep said there is no way to help between the gate rep and phone rep.
"@united They let us know in advance of the reboot, yes :) Thanks for the attentiveness!"
@united lol too little too Late Flight
@united yes. Bags came 1 hr after I arrived at baggage claim. Awful experience on the ground at BHM
@united @FernHeinig18 your delay is due to your own making. We have now been back to the gate multiple times. Maybe take accountability
@united Why do I have to give up my leg room so these 4 people (not in my row) can fill the bin?  Pls start charging. http://t.co/2nY5TuXFqf
@united please tell CLT flight 4232 needs a gate. Waiting now for 15 mins.
@united Why did you load us in this flying sardine can if you knew the pilots were 2 hours Late Flight?? #incompetent beyond belief
@united booked EWR-FLL in first for two on 3-8. Let's see how you compare to the garbage @AmericanAir first class has become
@united your seats are god awful.
@united good try but @SouthwestAir got her here safer and sooner
@United Wanted to compliment ur phone agent Jeanette for reFlight Booking Problems RDU to SEA thru SFO after connecting flight thru EWR was Cancelled Flightled.
@united 3 hour 45 min delay so far..... Would love to round to 4 hours to just go to bed!
@united Educate Bohol is a 501(c)(3) w/all volunteer staff. I can help the kids or buy a plane ticket ...I can't do both. Can you help?
"@united I need to get from Albuquerque, NM, USA, to Cebu, Philippines. I'm providing educational help for 800 kids. Can you help me?"
@united I'm on UA1118 and my direct tv isn't working.  How do I avoid this in future?
@United is truly the drunk uncle of boarding. Don't believe gate agent that overhead is full
@united i sure will
@united on the plane. I was thoughtful enough to ask for it and got it
"@united, any options to cos tonight? Doesn't look like #UA5525 will make it in time for #UA6259. Should I reserve a hotel room?"
"@united Appreciated, but in this case we waited an extra 55 minutes for a lost mechanic to fax the log. Fax...like in the 80s."
@united S/O to @Delta for coming in clutch and finally taking me home _٪�_٪�
@united customer service sucks!  They hang up after waiting an hour and talking for 5 minutes.
@united JP - DM message who? Can't get a DM through to @united
@united strikes again! Why board anyone if there's something wrong with the plane? Common sense.
@united:  thanks for the miserable trip GNV&lt
@united Missed KTM flight due to ur Cancelled Flightlation. Mike supervisor disgusting.  Now day Late Flight. No apology or upgrade offer to LHR from ORD???
@united left my iPad on MCO-&gt
@united social media team is on point on #OscarNight :)
@united always happy to start my life with my new wife with a 5 hr travel delay due to MAINTENECE and it would appear incompetence
@united is the airline of the Oscars but doesn't carry ABC on Direct TV?!?! Fail - now I can't watch the Oscars. #united
@united this is it... Last time I fly #UnitedAirlines  you screw up every trip now will be stuck in ord and miss work.
@united Didn't know that buying a seat in first class was just a 'request' to sit in first class! Very Interesting.
"@united I understand the intention, but it pales in comparison to a day of lost wages for both my wife and I because of the delay."
@united I need help with a missing bag.
@united I was. But I have given up.
"@united can I get on a stand by list from ASE to ORD? I'm the only poor person in Aspen, that's why I'm asking for standby on twitter."
@united you changed my entire flight plan for vacation and now I will be there alone a day and night early with nowhere to stay. Help!
@united UA647 heading back to gate bc improper load? if ur packing us to the gills should at least take care to load bags. expecting comp...
@united is the worst airlines sitting on the plane at  Houston-bush airport now for an hour and a half waiting for Late Flight passengers
@united might possibly have the worst service on the planet.
@united deceptive marketing practices promised me if i booked flights i would retain my status now they are not granting. Neverflyunited
@united Hey so many time changes for UA 1534. We going tonight or what? MIA - EWR
@united and that it would be sent on the next flight to Hayden/steamboat (HDN) from Denver. So I'm hoping its on there
@united and pick it up and just bring it on the shuttle. When I went to double check on that they said it was still on the concourse
@united I honestly couldn't tell you. All I know is that originally we were going to have it brought in from the concourse
@united missing a day of vacation to see my husband because of this delay but stuff happens and I get that. Just wish it was handled better
@united UA1534 has now had 11 different departure times. Wtf. Make up your mind.
@united thanks for making everyone wait in the dark for an hour while Newark tries to figure out which gate to go to. #incompetence
@united thank you for following up!
@United Claudia in IAH terminal b travel assistance has me all set. Great service. Thank you.
@united is it possible to add a Known Traveler Number to my ticket after Flight Booking Problems?
"@united why doesn't my daughter, booked with my gold member miles, get on the upgrade list for her flight tomorrow?"

@united this airline is a joke my friends been trapped in houston since 7am sat and have no flight in sight #unitedworstever #trappedhouston
@united why do you hate your passengers?
@united how can a plane that has been sitting in a hanger all day have numerous mechanical problems. Doesn't anyone actually do maintenance
.@united in the future when delay causes 15 hour wait (slept night in airport) ensuring seating choice for replacement flight would be good.
@united is my flight delayed? It keeps changing between delayed and not??? If delayed is checkin time Late Flightr??? http://t.co/NTUIx5dbYR
@united what a long day of delays. Please get us to Dallas tonight!!!!  Fingers crossed!!!  #winterstorm2015 #whichisworsedenordfw.
@united -How is it that all my flight times were changed without any official notification? Almost missed my flight this morning. Not cool!
@united they had record of it being at Denver on the concourse prior to me gettin on the shuttle. I just want to confirm its location
@united #LAX #sunrise UAL212 LAX-JFK
@united ...would be on the next flight to Hayden/steamboat
@united we needed to be at steamboat for a meeting by 3pm so we took a shuttle. The United customer service people said the bag would be on
"@united, there is no good word for describing how angry and pissed off of a customer you have made me."
"@united Late Flight 2014 and 2015 are huge step towards decline in service, and your agents, not all, are as arrogant as ever.  #UnitedAirlines"
@united Denver baggage handlers you totally impressed us today. Our lungs barely made the run to connect but our bags had no problem! #DEN
"@united flight 3870 to Newark, stuck in the runway. About to miss my connection and they are just sorry for my inconvenience!!!!!!"
@united false.
"@united sitting on the runway in Newark, they won't let the plane to a gate. My connection boards in 1 minute. @united hates us all."
"@united thanks, it was my first time in a United lounge and felt welcomed."
".@united all other ANA ticket holders get to use the lounge, too. But not us. Because United booked us. #grumpykim"
"@united Good evening, UA. Can you assist with an issue via DM?"
@united Never had a flight delayed an hour due to an unbalanced load. And more delays at @flyLAXairport. Great job idiots.

@united and to add to my earlier tweet. This was my daughters 5th Bday present. Thank you for the hard work and making it happen.
@united you have a guy named Otis at ORD that knows what #customerservice is. he was able to get my bag to me. I upgraded just to be sure

"@United��� has Cancelled Flighted 1 arrival into SHV tonight &amp; the 1st departure flight on Mon, Feb 23rd. Check with your airline for flight status."
@united it was such a lovely part of this long day - attendants on UA5168 (most) /UA795 were beyond exceptional today. #GiveThoseLadiesRaise
@united 4 open seats in 1st class on UA 2065. Way to honor your upgrade policy for freq flyers and/or honor an employee with an upgrade.
@united I trust you enough to put my coat in my checked bag!
@united yes I have &amp
@united of course. But interesting how United doesn't seem to have a good sense on what's happening with flight
@united pushing five hours and my time is worth nothing to you. reFlight Booking Problems not an option unfortunately.
"@united finally made it to rep, who solved my problem."
@united you guys are complete ass
@united thanks gate agent extraordinaire Seau Fong for helping me get re-booked out of Boise and (hopefully) home to NYC sometime tonight!
@united why are your agents working so slowly to rebook people who are on #UA1481. We have all wasted an entire day at STT.
@united Thank y'all for being an amazing airline who knows how to treat their customers. you guys rock!
@united you friend's flt from ase to Denver is Cancelled Flightled for tomorrow.  Can you help with rebook?
@united - Plane came in with broken seat.  Rather than fix it they put a broken sign on it and separated me from my kids.
@united worst flying experience ever and they tried to blame it on ATC?! I watched them load bags for 30min after boarding 45min Late Flight
@united used to (still do?) let you listen to flight radio...I often did...interesting to me #TCMParty #CE3K #31DaysOfOscar
@united went to Customer Service kiosk and they were able to help out! Still thanks for following up!
@united have you read your own same day travel change policy?
"@united your b737-800w  literally the smallest seats I have ever have, my dad got stuck In the tiny bathroom ad well #disspointed #premier1k"

@united nope all set. Thx for checking.
@united +the plane.
"@united my flight was already Cancelled Flightled this morning because of a ""snow storm in Denver"". And now I'm in DC waiting for a pilot to get on+"

"@united on 2/20 Denver AP, gate B91 (destination Santa Fe), agent Ashley did an amazing job in the face of an angry traveler. Kudos."
@united has an United flight ever been on time. #americanisbetter
@united I'd rather spend two days in the back seat of a Volkswagen than two hours on your plane! #disgruntled #whatacluster
@united my flight was supposed to depart to Boston at 4:36 and now it's departing at 6:30 due to issues with finding a pilot. Thanks a lot!!
@united I suppose your customers enjoy screaming toddlers then. Not my problem if someone complains!
"@united you could give me free flights for life, and I'd still choose to purchase my tickets from a competitor."
@united The first time I flew United was horrible thought I would give you a second chance. There will NOT be a third! #disgruntled
@united flight from san fransico to jfk was evacuated why?
"@united 4994 out of Jackson, Wyoming... Delayed by no pilots.. Full toilets.. Deplaned 2ndary to mechanical fail.. Cancelled Flightled flight pending"

"@united ... I want my bag off flight 1142, what do I do now?"
@united thanks for causing us to miss our connection and now a 6hour delay #flydeltanexttime
@united I do not see where it talks about military baggage fees. Can you please guide me. Thanks
@united I hope you lose the next govt contract
@united lost my bags and there was a flight from Chi to Eri that landed over 1.5 hrs ago...yet still have zero updates?? #UnitedAirlinesSux
@united i will just send my confirmation number when I get home safe and sound. This is why i pay so expensive services to you!
@united the bag is in a state that I didn't travel to and the airports don't fly to each other. Looks like it'll never show
@united ridiculous! I have to be refunded whenever I get at my final destination or not!
@united stay more than 24h traveling ans sleeping on the airports floor
@united seriously?   UA 806.  Delayed because of the copilot isn't here?  For 1.5 hours and he is only flying from Raleigh? Disappointing
@united seriously. This is just complete bs.
"@united, we've been waiting for over an hour for our luggage- what gives?"
@united the costumer services here at Denver Intl Airport is ridiculous bad!
@united Lied to my face at the gate about upgrades. Thanks. #badservice #unitedsucks
@united I have proof that my situation now is due to company mistake
@united ouch not fair
@united is synonymous to with #rude. And #cheap. You really don't know how to value the customer
@united I have to go back home! I have to use what the company has available. But it's unfair to stay more than 24 h traveling
@united if I miss the #Oscars I'll never fly united again
@united is the stingiest airline. Nobody should model after them. #PTFO #cheap #bastards #stingy
"@united flight delayed...again...every time. ""Maintenance issues"""
@united I should be fine. They automatically changed my connecting flight for me so I wouldn't miss it. A+ work.
@united yes... A ride home would be perfect.. A fete one would assume possible after charging 1600$ for a domestic flight... Ps we deplaned
@united I'll be calling tomorrow
@united and I was denied an upgrade because of catering issues??? #poorservice
@united--excited to barrel through the sky at 600mph on a 75 ton piece of metal operated by a company that can't get their tiny TVs to work!
"@united heard about the voucher/miles credit for Cancelled Flighting my international flight yesterday, but I didn't get an email."
"@united, maybe don't play the video about how your flights are outfitted w wifi on the flights where wifi isn't working...����"
@united on line baggage system complete rubbish. bag missing 2 days. No meaningful information.
@united...do you still have flat tire policy.  Shuttle broke down on way to ORD.  Will probably miss the 425pm to CLE...Help please!!
@united thanks. Just was able to do it on the app myself. Still not customer service to be seen in YYZ
"@united thx off the response, finally got through the 45 min wait and talked to someone."
@united so unhelpful... http://t.co/vBfIeo2qJC
@united I would take the $500 voucher you offered for MISCOUNTING THE # OF SEATS ON YOUR PLANE but that means I would have to fly you again
@united - 3 of 6 First seats open on UA5097. No upgrades processed. Gate agents @yyz said their too busy. Not cool http://t.co/6KpyhckA9l
@united @rayja9 flying to las vegas out of Chicago flight is Late Flight and no announcement has been made
@united I believe. It was Cancelled Flighted yesterday I guess. Goes back to no notification from United about Cancelled Flightlation
"@United - In case you're reading this, UA230, right now, 7D. So many oversized carryons taking up too much room. Enforce your rules."

@united stuck in YYZ because staff took a break? Not happy 1K....
@United Personal Device Entertainment system is great but with app crashing every 10/15 mins I'm glad it's free for now.
@united pls stop sending texts every 15mins saying my flight is delayed another 15mins-It's been 3hrs. I usually defend u but this is lame..
"@united agent, ""You should use the bathroom before boarding.. Toilets onboard are full."" Oh you can expected a strongly worded email FUnited"
"@united should hire extra customer service reps. 50 minute wait time to ask one question? I would rather just fly another airline, thanks."
@united united flight UA3774 after two delays just Cancelled Flightled no explanation &amp
@united I'll try it. Mileage programs have historically been a lifeline for us world-hungry travelers of moderate means.
"@united any way you can help me find a flight to LAS? Stuck in DIA, sat on plane 2 hrs, now been waiting an hour for an update."
@United 50 minute wait times to help with a Cancelled Flightled flight?? Help a guy out?
@united I was rebooked but had to take bus from Portland Maine to Boston. Told United does not cover the charge.
@united there is a sector whereby it says $0 in both bags...no bag allowance at all in international flight?
@United You were doing so well until the PHL-SFO flight yesterday. Major miss. Unfriendly Premier cabin crew. Baggage cluster at SFO.
"@united Your baggage tracking system is worthless! It tells me nothing about where the bag is, much less what your plans are to get it to me"
@United is offering to reroute my SFO flight to LAX. Might be geography class time.
@united thank you for letting me down.My luggage is still in Denver but I'm in Phl. #neveragain #flyingwithUS #disappointed #lostacustomer
@united can you get me on the delayed flight to EWR out of YYZ at 15:30? No customer service to be found in airport
@united flight UA3774 after two delays. just Cancelled Flightled and no more flights to Norfolk that aren't booked. Renting a car.
"@united thanks for having no one to pilot my last two flights, and all but stranding me in Houston tonight.  Airlines are the absolute worst"
@united so disgusted and disappointed with united airlines luggage policies and attitude toward musicians. Unacceptable
"@united missing my amazing us bank work conference, not ok.  What do I do now?????"
"@united ... frozen lines on flight, not continuing due to 'passenger comfort'? Not ok, sat on the plane as long as a flight to Vegas would !"
@united my last call your customer service agent called me back... As he was stuck on hold to air Canada.. Just hope he's booked me a flight
@united you left my bag in Houston last night. It's freezing cold in Memphis. Any idea on when I will see it? Off again tomorrow.
@united this is why I fly @SouthwestAir ... Never have any issues
@united has terrible customer service &amp
"@united I have tried and you have failed. Still no wifi ever, last row in the middle and I fly every week. Thanks for nothing."
@united great flight into PVD. Smallest plane I have ever been on and smoothest landing ever!
@united trying to check in for tomorrow's flight. website keeps timing out. what's up?

@united Do you have Bereavement discount on airfare as my grandfather just passed and need to attend his funeral this week.

���@united:That's not something we like to hear. Hopefully our staff can resolve &amp
@united You must follow me in order for me to send you a direct message if that is what you meant.
@united I don't know what DM the confirmation number means.
"@united Waiting for 3494 EWR-ORD, delayed 47 mins. Might miss 5491 ORD-YWG at 6pm CT. Any room on 5644 ORD-YWG in case I miss connex?"
@united What does DM the confirmation @ mean???
"@united - well, now finally on board hopefully we take off this time and quickly. Well over an hour delay!!"
@united I missed my connection already. Then I missed the next flight they put me on.  Now I'm going to LAX instead of Hawaii.  :(
@united reservation was made last July. I want to know why I wasn't reseated. This only happens on international itineraries
@united line full of worried customers and guy at desk says so sorry you will have to take care of your problems Late Flightr I don't have time.
"@united 

There must be 100 people waiting in line for customer service at DEN to deal with flight Cancelled Flightations."
"@united, American never had my bags apparently. United never switched them over. Had to go back to United Baggage Service."
@united unacceptable. 403 was 90 min Late Flight for a 'missing screw' our flight to Tucson left before we even landed
"@united CMH gate staff a disaster..#3345 overbooked, no volunteers, no boarding, 20 min Late Flight trying to figure out issue #bringbackrealstaff"

@united Are your earnings so low that checkin people have to also be on Tarmac loading bags? JAN
"@united thank you for dishonoring my upgrade and putting me in a seat I didn't want, all while not even notifying me.  Great 1K service _��_"
@united you guys are gay
@united the emails/calls over the past months about flight changes were helpful wish you would have sent them on the Cancelled Flightlation yesterday
"@united - so they changed depart from 1:45 to 2:00pm &amp; it is now 1:40pm &amp; the Capt. just got off the plane to find a smoothie, 2pm my ass!!!"
"@united Thanks so much , my passport was recovered"
@united  Thanks for nothing! No Atlanta Lounge? Your Ap says NO. Sure nothing at Terminal T http://t.co/tFjfMSHa2k
@united no thank you
"@united - tick, tock, tick, tock, it is rapidly approaching the next dream departure of 1:45pm. When is the next fantasy departure time??"
@united it would make my day if I could take a flight on your airline without any hiccups on your end. Train your employees to communicate
"@united a baby shit its pants half way through my flight and it smelled like shit, what are you going to do about this?"
"@united You cause me to miss my flight telling me it already left when it had not. No empathy from gate staff or crew, no apology. Really?"
@United rescheduled my return flight from #Japan?  Uh why?  Trying to call #UnitedAirlines #customerservice - 45 min wait.  #fun
@united is by far the worst airline ever _���_���
"@united, no. Re-booked with American and United said they'd transfer our bags to them."
@united I am appalled at your lack of communication during our awful journey on 2/21 EWR to BOS. 4 hr delays need to be explained better.
@united I'm DMing my info and no is assisting. My flight home left before m first flight had even landed
@united Boston is all self service. Swipe yr own boarding pass at gate. Most difficult: Tag your own bag. Not easy! #ImproveTheProcess
@united Name correct on original confirmation but spelled wrong on check-in reminder. First name and MI run together. Cause for concern?
@united more people would catch their flights if your attendants had more help!
"@United no consistency, #Denver agents say no standby with checked baggage citing FAA. Your website policy says otherwise. #time2switch"
Only 14 biz days (18 calendar) to respond to my inquiry @united ?  I hope your standards are universally adopted :-/ #BadCustomerService
@united Thanks but why did this occur? You guys had 3 hours extra to get my bag on due to your delay. So that's 7 hours you had. #fail!
@united so many delays today...What's up with that? Hoping my 12:26pm flight boards soon. #United #premier1K
"@united your website is fucked up. Now instead of a $416 flight I should�۪ve had yesterday, it�۪s $514 today. Thanks."
@united called back and I've been on hold. What is the issue?! I have a confirmation number and an email that shows how much I've paid
"@united I'm not sure how you can help. Your flight experience is terrible, planes are dirty and staff is rude. Start over perhaps?"
@united check in and it's still saying I haven't paid. I've called back twice was on hold for 30 minutes then they answered and hung up. I

@united thanks. Just got on a couple of minutes ago. Great service on flight 479 btw. Please pass it to the team on that flight.
@united My bag is lost and I can't get ahold of anyone that can help
@united Then you delete my return ticket to Europe and blame me for the now show? This airline is a joke. 3 times this happened now.3 times!
"@united When my United flight arrives Late Flight and I'm told to re-book my connecting United flight, you characterize that as a ""no show"""
@united your agents (and service) on my weekend trip have been AMAZING!!! Thank you!!
@united never flying United again! Worst experience ever
"@united @TiffanyAndCo @NTrustOpen ah, so that's where the funds to fix the broken plane upon which I sat for 4 hrs on IAH runway went."

@united direct messages not going through please help
"@United why not charge for 2nd carryon instead of checked bag? Less jockeying for overhead space, happier passengers, more ontime departures"
@united Adding reservation to iOS app doesn't show up on desktop site when logged in. And miles can't be redeemed for upgrades thru your app
@united I assume that would be for the other 300 people who have been let down by United? What's worse is plane is here but crew can't fly!!
@united   Pushing 2 hours on hold. Priceless. http://t.co/thS10LDY2a
@united will do. Just need to get CVG.... and my bag too. Thanks
"@united read the thread. I booked 1st class , now seated at 38E even though United Twtr account confirmed Eco Premium."

@united doesn't purchasing ticket with a united card give me priority boarding ?
"@united hi yes need a free hotel stay in Honalulu due to 4 hour delayUA53, since we will miss our second flight to Kauai"
@united so what's the solution?
@united is screwing with my flights again at CAE? Why do you bother having flights here if they never leave on time or get Cancelled Flighted?
@united no. I need you to have more than 2 agents at check in.
@united so this did not work out at all!! Incredibly unfriendly ground staff and false promises over Twitter @theairhelper
"@united we got it, thanks."
@united The so below skilled staff and inadequate system just deleted my return from Houston to Norway. Shoulder shrugging is all you do..

@united who authors this fiction? I just heard on radio we don't even have a jetway secured yet #UA5037 #CMH http://t.co/T78k7aBtWF
@united so? Found anything or just showing off? You do realise that the morning flight that you Cancelled Flightled was more pricey than the evening?
@united oh I did. Was still lost. Your tracking system stinks as does the delivery system.
@united feeling like a true united customer stuck.on the tarmac in dc for over 2 hrs. UNITEDFAIL
@united pls follow for DM.
@united leadership counts. landed at 11:15 last night-deplaned at 12:40. 45 minutes of that was waiting for the jetway. Inexcusable
@united I sent you a DM as requested but have not heard anything. Can you address the issue I brought up in my DM and explain what happened?
@united employee=faceless. Don't throw them under the bus. Starts with management. I'm almost a million miler and own my own company. 1/2
@united you can't say the flight is pulled in and departs in 2 mins if boarding hasn't even started! http://t.co/2IKbP8gxWi
@united  I understand that but why should I pay to change if it was a problem with your plane. If it was weather I would understand
@united 30 hours Late Flightr still no answers stuck in Houston. Keep getting put on phantom flights that never apeared. #BadCustomerService
@united you guys are horrible! First we get stuck in the snow for a hr in ewr now sitting in cmh saying it could be 30min for a gate
"@united the hotel you sent us to wouldnt take the voucher. Our flight was delayed, then Cancelled Flightled, then delayed again. 32 hours and counting"
@united DM'd you 4 hrs ago at your request. No response to be found .... just like my bag.
@united worked out after all. Thanks for your immediate reply!!

@united last week we also had maintenance issues and a flat tire. Another flight last week was Cancelled Flighted. Your track record is the WORST!
@united this customer service experience will be tweeted for quality assurance.

@united any chance you could help rebook?? My flight Cancelled Flightled

@united Yes. To Boston. I was going to Providence.
@united you really need a better system for handling Cancelled Flightled flights http://t.co/3uBCoAsyws
@united how are conditions in BOS today? I'm in UA994. Everything appears to be in time but I wanted to check.
@united same day flights
@united It is also inappropriate to lie to passengers to induce them into accepting a voucher by telling them you have availability on Late Flightr
@United give me a direct number I can call regarding my lost baggage immediately.
@united involuntarily bumped your passenger and can't guarantee them another flight for three days!
@united Please follow FAA guidelines regarding bumping. It is NOT acceptable to give a $300 voucher for an $800 fare when you've

@united lost 4 loyal customers and mileage plus card holders. We could have driven to Florida from Pa quicker both ways! Worst trip ever!
@united they let us board again but will we fly this time? Who knows! #shouldhaveflowndelta
@united apparently sleeping in B terminal wasn't the worst situation. Someone told other UA passengers they had to sleep at baggage claim.
@united why don't you de-ice while the plane sits there with no one in it for 2 hours ?? Or we could just delay :/
@united fuck you for not caring _��
"@united its been five days, I'm just asking you to clarify your policy on car seats. I don't want to have to take this higher up."

Very quick! TY. @united: @auciello I am sorry to hear this. Can you please follow and DM me the details of what transpired? ^JH
@united if you lost my belongings then BE HONEST!

@United DO NOT FLY UNITED WITH CHECKED BAGGAGE! It will never find you!
@United why can't you have an English/Spanish rep call me so we can locate my bag and resolve this issue?
@united why would you overnight my bag Wed to an unknown location with a courier company you apparently can't contact!
"@united Hey, thanks again for helping me miss my buddies 30th bday, you guys are really a trashy company #shouldhaveflowndelta #unitedsucks"
@united I have never been more frustrated than my conversations with United who can't speak Spanish to the courier company that has my bag!

@united you've got to be kidding me. I still haven't talked to a human and your robotweeting me?! And asking for a follow????
".@united I wouldn't describe feces sprinkled in your bathroom as an inconvenience. To help, you might find my baggage you lost &amp; return it."
@united and the fact that we were treated disrespectfully and lied to by members of your airline that claims to strive for the best
"@united is that all that matters, not the fact that we're at a different destination, we were put through a tremendous amount of stress,"
@united 1k member broken seat back broken tv broken light lost bag  gee thnx. UA922 awesome job
@united absolutely disgusting the way you treat your customers. Isn't there anyone actively monitoring your Cust serve? This is  unreal!!
@united nice. I wonder how you pick who to respond to? Maybe only happy customers are easier. I wonder how many of those you have left.
@united averaging 200 minute wait times tonight or what? I've gotten no help from you tonight.
@united thanks for nothing. Really?!? 60 minute wait times when I've had to call back 4x. That's 240minute wait times.
@united you're customer service is unbelievably bad. Abysmal. I've been on the phone for well over 2hrs tonight. Hung up on by yr ppl 3x.
@united you can read the full story when I submit a case to your team about the pilot of flight 6232 and why we are sleeping in DIA
@united what's with the layover in Canada from the UA125? Is that scheduled?
@united an inconvenience is a weather delay. Your pilot deciding to waste enough time so the FAA wouldn't let him fly is negligence.
@united I bought a ticket with a price that was published by mistake and now I got an email that indicates United Cancelled Flightled my ticket! Why?
@united new 737 plane
@united - you sure missed the mark on tonight's redeye from LAX to Chicago. What a mess! You can do better!
@united after 443min of avoidable non-weather delays that #Appreciation link better be giving out #GoldenTickets
@united where is our luggage
@united we just left @flySFO (delayed). http://t.co/XzBAjMiekx
@united all set. Figured it out at the baggage office!
@united screws up again...to be expected! NEVER AGAIN!
@united why don't you allow families with small children to board first anymore? Our next flight will be on another airline...
@united Life goal: complete ��ӕ�
@united I have $20 and I'll draw you a super sweet picture of your choosing. Will that get me round-trip to San Diego? _�Ϋ_�Ϋ It's so cold here.
@united flight Cancelled Flightled to Denver service agent offered me a non jet salt lake to Denver or red eye out of Atlanta then hung up on me.
"@united That's called throwing ""loyalty"" out the window and trying to give less awards."
"@united your unhelpful team? Sure I did. I'm in Bangkok, my bag in Chicago. Are u going to pay for my accommodation s until my bag arrives??"
"@united I'd hardly call going from 10,000 miles to 1,000+ miles a ticket cutting edge. About 1/10 the perk?"
@united that's not an apology. Say it.
@united Just sent a DM. Thank you for the acknowledgment.
@united download jeokoo the American app for air travelers
@united been on hold for almost two hours trying to talk to someone about a Cancelled Flighted flight tomorrow morning. What do you suggest?
@united no apology? Cool.
"@united you ask a lot of customers who  you routinely screw over. You know that, right?"
@united I'm a first time solo female traveller and it's pretty scary being in a foreign place not knowing where your belongings are...
"@united I am. Who knows where my bags are. Do I just wait around and hope they arrive? No one has answers, I have plans and no answers...."
@united somehow I knew that you'd wait until I was airborne to respond. #hacks #jokers #neveragain.
@united Missing flight attendant = Delayed Flight. Prime example how 1 person impacts 100's of people. HNL -&gt
@united has me stranded in Texas and then hangs up on me when I'm trying to figure out how to get home. Cool.
@united we have tried to change our flight THREE times on the phone and got disconnected each time.
"@united poor showing today, no assistance to passengers who mis connected due to maintenance and waiting for baggage"
"@united has been showing the same tone deaf video for all these years about how ""wifi is coming!"" Hah.Not before I leave. @VirginAmerica ftw"
@united Can I get a follow? I fly with you for Christmas.
"@united more people stranded cause you suck. Better yet, you weasel out of Flight Booking Problems rooms for people claiming weather http://t.co/Flcnnn2USD"
@united look at all the delta flights that landed while your pilots claimed they couldn't fly 6232 to JAC. http://t.co/6Kp4m0R1f7
@united thank you! Much appreciation for your help.
"@united Been sitting on flight 435 for an hour after landing in Newark. First no gate, then no jetway operator. Seriously!?"
@united worst customer service experience ever. 40 minutes to get the jetway to the plane at EWR tonight. Flight 354   Disappointed
@united - not only 2 hour delay - double booked seat nit parked at wrong gate - incompetence at its finest - been waiting  for over 1 hr
@united look at the people tryn to sleep in the airport due to your shitty company not comping rooms after cxl flight http://t.co/o1u96Xc3bo
"@United - routing a person from Houston to Newark, NJ  and then to SFO is not acceptable."
@united Phone
"@united Freakin"""
@united Pick
@united Suck
@united 25 minute hold is 1 hr. 25 min. @ABC11_WTVD
@united 20 yrs of flying Continental/united exclusively I get why everyone hates you - fl1289sfo/EWR #getmeoffrhisFUCKINplane
@united 24 seats available on the 2:15 pm from ORD to RDU...I need 2 seats please
@united I'm still trying to get things worked out and you have yet to respond back.
"@united screwed up our reservation- they assigned a new # to just one of us &amp; when they changed our flight, only changed the original #."
@united 25 min hold has now progressed to over an hour...919-675-0985
@united YOU SUCK!
"@united yo, you need a new website really badly. This day and age..."
@united if I was rebooked do I have to pick up my luggage?
@united how can u not have gate ready or gate agent for going on hour two
@united just DM'd
@united had a different fiasco on my outward trip and was rebooked on to qantas lax-Syd. No FF miles show up in my account for that :(
@united I am following - you need to follow me for DM?
@united it would be great to get a callback from the agent that disconnected me trying to put me on hold after waiting to connectfor 60+min
"@united not a good day to fly u, two delayed flights still on plane at Ewr waiting over 1,5 hours for gate get to gate no gate agent."
@united just called and did it. Should have earlier because I'm being sent to DCA first and THEN to pvd. We may rent a car instead.
"@united my luggage is set to go to DCA however, I am rerouted to Dulles. Currently in NOLO however bags are in Houston. Can you fix this?"
@united I went from Sacramento to Minneapolis at the end of October 2014 in business class.
@united I'm extremely disappointed w my service for this trip as a #United #MileagePlus Explorer Card holder.
@united I hope your corporate office is ready to deal with the rage created by your shitty service and bullshit pilots. #UnitedAirlinesSucks
@united such a relaxing space for a drink before my flight! (at @United Global First Lounge) https://t.co/j4cj0lrF2d http://t.co/dTLGUQ1kAk
@united i will never fly with you again. i went on vacation this week and you lost my bags both ways. now i have no clothes. thankyou
@united sadly this wasnt just due to mother nature investigate this incident and your employees at sfo. Terrible customer experience
@united flight ua90 is taking off now after 1750 was delayed over 4 hrs 30 passengers to miss their flight to tel aviv
@united 30 of us on flight 1750 trying to get to tel aviv that is trying to take off right now with out us so cruel. Next flight is 350pm
"@united considering I'm now stuck in Newark with virtually sleep in 30+ hours, I doubt it :/ hope car rentals are available"
@united I see several economy plus can you put us in those. We don't have to be seated together
@united What a really GREAT &amp
@united I see you coming to get me and @AggieMensGolf in Hawaii! #12thMan http://t.co/G8DKa3Edhf
@united Airline SUCKS! Customer Service SUCKS! NO courtesy! Incompetent - passengers do NOT matter- Bet the CEO is just doing fine though!
@united do you expect to Cancelled Flight flights out of @DENAirport tomorrow morning given the storm?
@United also ran out of water and refused service #costumerservice #legit #jk
@united I have a question
@United Can you increase the legroom? : How airlines compare http://t.co/diUfep8n2q via @CNNMoney
"@united on a 4 seg flt yvr to zurich, why would you credit all miles and but only 2 segs on full fare?"
@united I see two flights with two seats in the morning can we get on those
@united 6377 and now they sent our green tagged bags to the luggage carousel. It's been one mess up after another. Bad day @united
@united the lounge tells us they have no pillows for my grandma as one of the ladies opens the closet and I see 2 right there. #unitedlies
@united the drunk guy you threw out of flight UA936 4hrs ago is better off than the rest of us held up for 5hrs in the plane without food.
"@united sitting in Denver airport waiting for a plane to be refueled. For an hour and a half! Hurry the fuck up United, you fucking retards"
@united we will be at the airport first thing in the morning
@united I'm rebooked on a flight tomorrow even though I had 1st class seat orig I have a lousy coach seat
@united well this one missed the mark.  She was in a snit from the minute I stepped up to the counter
@united Doesn't have to be same flight 2 and 2 will work also
@united who compensates is for the delays caused by the fact that you don't have enough flight attendants?? http://t.co/96apr35qan
@united we've been seating for 5hrs inside flight UA936 at #IAD delayed. We've only been offered water &amp
@united please get me off this plane #UA57
@united yes. On a nonstop to Memphis tomorrow morning. With the snow coming in I got my fingers crossed it will go.
@united traveling with 3 young kids!! Chose our original flights for a reason.
@united have since dropped to 2 layovers but still not acceptable.
@united our 1 layover itinerary was swapped for a 3 layover itinerary - really?!?
"@united your app says flight UA936 to #ZRH departed 2:45hrs Late Flight, but 5 hours Late Flightr we are still seating inside the plane in #IAD.  #failed"
@united not completely.  Our flight was changed in July but we never received notification.
@united are there any upgrades avail to get us all on the same flight
@united Wife and I have two new destinations and I'm stuck in DC until Monday with no bags
@united no I don't. Spoke with baggage contact at 1-800 number. Said they will try to get bags to stay at IAD for pick up tmrw
@united can you make sure I�۪m on the upgrade list for 2/23 EWR-PDX using my GPU priority? Got a weird email about it.
@united so is that two seats avail so far for us.
@united has once again earned a place as the worst airline in the business
@united is flight number 1142 Denver to Las Vegas 1125 on Sunday feb 22 Cancelled Flighted ?
"@united when I read it say ' in some cases' can you please define this for me, when for example would it not be the case?"
@united I'm trying your WiFi on UA1616. But sorry it really slow. Even #Spotify lagging and that isn't a hard stream.
"@united Not until tomorrow night. And the hotel voucher had higher rate than travelocity Not loving cost, but hard working staff"
"@united flight UA1459 sitting at newark waiting for a gate, seriously??? #threehoursLate Flight"
@united why don't you ever print my known #traveler number on my ticket? Because of this I never get to use the #TSA prescreen I paid for
"@united boarding was decent, 3 useless agents that don't speak English (after 2.5hrs of hold) 6hrs of mech delay not so much"
"@united After all I have been through on this trip, can you get me on another airline home?"
@united flight was Cancelled Flighted after the last opportunity to rebook us on other flights this evening passed.
@united boarding a #plane would be much faster if you boarded back to front instead of front to back #MakesSense #efficiency #travel #flying
"@united it's 9:56, and the desk attendant stated we would ""sit awhile"" until given the all clear. Lack of communication seems to the norm."
@united had been suffering immensely ever since this merge .. Hopefully I'll never have to fly @united ever again ..
@united I'd really like to get off of this plane now.
@united possibly the worst airlineGave them three chances Second time in 2 weeks a flight has been delayed and or Cancelled Flightled due to mechanics
@united cabin pressurization issues are pretty serious. Flight 1109 landed in Washington because of it. My head is pounding.
@united Sandra at ur international checkin counter was rude and offensive.  She commented she didn't care if I complained cuz she had 25yrs
@united My contact stuff is in the bag and I'm legally blind. This is so messed up.
@united Did I mention that I was ON THE PLANE so is my luggage. My luggage that I'm not going to have for how many days.
@united 3 times I've called customer services each at least 40 mins... Each time cut off by your operators... Why can't you call me back!
@united Tell me that you're at least going to cover a room and get me out of here.
@united OMG!!! you just bumped me off the last flight. Can this get any worse.
@united Which just speaks to basically the worst designed web system ever.
"@united Yeah, I tried that about 10 times for two different tickets, and it told me to ""Try again Late Flightr""."
@united please fire the captain of flight 6232 today. He single handedly ruined every passengers day by being a piece of shit. #unitedsucks
@united U blow
@united what exactly do you hang on this hook? http://t.co/ZHxOk07Aqa
"@United - flight Cancelled Flightled. 4 hrs at airport to book a new one for $95. Just got two invoices for the flight, each for approx $300. Really?!"
@united why do you hire POS pilots? Thanks for ruining my trip and not allowing me to see my buddy as he turns 30. #unitedsucksdick
.@united Your airline is again rated the WORST in America so you've got your work cut out for you. It's bc you treat customers like garbage.
@united what's the best way to get your tickets? Print off at home or go to check in desk?
@united Pay for my hotel.... I'm a broke student #help
@united all 4 of us are on standby in Houston tomorrow for flights to Calgary. If you could get us on one or two of those that would help
@united what a nightmare!!  Both sides of my flights are a disaster!  At Houston getting attitude cuz I was sent to ticket counter
@united you're terrible.
@united it was eventually explained that weather conditions too extreme to get luggage off planes. Will be sent on. But I won't be for days!
@united Anyone there? Did you read my DM?
@united 732 from Denver. We just boarded! Fingers crossed we get into the air!!!
"@united EWR TO MCO made unplanned landing because of pressurization failure. Worst pain I've EVER felt, I thought I was going to pass out"
@united How does that make a flight takeoff on time? And regardless it makes me Late Flight because now I have to wait for my bag at baggage claim.
@united it's been over 3 hours...at what point do you let people off of the plane? @FoxNews @CNN @msnbc
@united trying to get a customer service agent.  Just landed in SFO.  Can't fly with 3 layovers with 3 kids!!
@united why are there no early morning flights from HNL to anywhere in the continental US? Example- Monday 4/20. Need flight to PHL
@united nope I gave up - maybe they'll deliver it
@united Thanks for the upgrade- please try to get my company to approve more business class travel.
@united more and more delays! No CS help at all! No notifications!
@united and waiting
@united hoping there is a spare a/c for 1171 tomorrow!  Have a ship to board!  The sched aircraft is delayed from previous flts.
@united Hubby made it by the skin of his teeth!   :)
@united the incompetence is truly stunning at this point. 4 hours on a plane for a 1.75 hour nonstop flight.
"@united 1st u delay my flight for mechanical failure,then 2 hrs on the runway, &amp; 13 hrs Late Flightr I'm still here with a lost bag &amp; no resolution"
@united is the worst
@united still waiting
"@united thanks for the reply. To clarify, the airfare is similar to your likely intended peer group. The $3 beer charge, however, is not"
"@united...lies lies lies....still sitting at the gate, have not moved an inch http://t.co/LulGnwEfFH"

"@united #customerservice at @Dulles_Airport could not be worse. I get the bad weather, but this is awful."
@united any plans of restating nonstop service between IAD and South Florida?  We miss our flights to FLL.
"@united instead of be told when we board, we have to wait for the emails telling us about the delays."
"@united Additionally, my husband paid for tv service &amp; it stopped working about halfway through the flight."
@united following
"@united unfortunately, they didn't. I asked the staff if they could help. they said we should ask ppl in our row to switch, but no one would"

"@united do u serve peanuts/nuts on yr flights yr policies r confusing contradictory advice Pls help #Anaphylaxis,will u ask those 2 refrain?"
@united is there another airport closer to Calgary we can fly out of tomorrow.
@united Nope! I'm on UA 174 that was supposed to leave at 6:47 but are still at the gate. Apparently we are about to pull back and de-ice.
"@united Still do not have my bag, it's in the CLT airport. Was originally told I would have it by 2pm."
@united Yes. About an hour after landing.
@united just texted me to say flight is delayed due to air traffic control. BS! They pulled the plane in Late Flight #lies

@united Flight has been delayed for another hour so only have 24 mins to transit at LAX... Extremely unlikely I will make it!
@united 4595. We are now going back to the gate b/c of something overheating after sitting out here for 3+ hours.Love United but this stinks
@united congratulations united. Fail again. Sky at a gate with a plane full of people waiting on 2. Weather gets worse now we can't leave.
"@united thank you for leaving my bag in houston! despite what your system says, i was definitely on the flight!"
@united how come a $27 shuttle bus from LGA to EWR has electrical power outlets but our new Airbus interiors do not? #whyjeff?
Reply to @united - Doesn't do any good to check outlets preflight when moved to different equipment after boarding due to malfunction.
@united 15-hr flight w/broken #Dreamliner media system. Witness #mental #breakdown as we bounce off walls. Remind me why I'm 1K.
@united I was rebooked thru SFO but arrive 9 hours Late Flight and miss activities. I asked to fly today with stop over. Was told I'd have to pay.
@united never again.
@united tonight you made this Fred Flintstone happy with an upgrade to 1st class. http://t.co/gKgKZLAwpR
@united who do I need to contact regrading a complaint and to get a voucher funds for future travel on United?
@united is trying to strand us in Houston until tomorrow morning. pretty sure overFlight Booking Problems and maintenance aren't our fault.
@united  your costumer service today in the Providence airport was sucked. Recommend your airline learn to check the weather and be honest
@united fire yr rep who refused to put me on a flight that I had a boarding pass and seat on. Full explanation and her name in complaint.
@united that's great! pls let me know when u start!
@united @ehsanisMpowered lmfao
"@united God damn fucking crew won't be here till 6:40, so you've known for over an hour and a half the flight time was bullshit."
@united you really do have a culture problem. Everyone I tried to work with blamed someone else or told me how they're short staffed
@united sucks.
@united I can understand that but to not have another plane available when there is a full day till departure is unacceptable. Phoenix?
@united is honestly RUINING MY FUCKING LIFE RIGHT NOW. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@united Flight Cancelled Flightled to BDL and stranded @Dulles_Airport. Waiting almost 2hrs at customer service. Shout out to diligent agents.
@united where's the crew for ua748?

@united quality work going on here. http://t.co/9xbO5daKaK
@united No customer service rep could confirm where my bag was &amp
@united We've let you know how to help the millions of customers you've treated like garbage. It's no coincidence ur ranked WORST airline.
"@united yes, after landing at 930pm last night. Spoke to 10 baggage claim customer service reps. Finally spoke to one amazing ticket agent."
@united Charging $6500 for biz flight to UK = somewhat egregious. Charging $3 on top for a Sam Adams draft at the United Club is usurious.
@united I see. Thanks for explaining.
@united Your social listening capabilities are awful if this is the reply for the context in which you were mentioned @stevelord212
@united If you follow me I will DM you my phone # which you can call.
"@united After an hour+ wait, my issue is resolved. I did contact customer service to comment on the wait time. Thanks for contacting me."
"@united Yes, they did. Must have fixed the broken ramp. Thanks!"

"@united cabin crew were huge offenders, stood as a conversational cluster blocking exiting passengers"
@united allowing passengers on my flight to block exit of plane

"@united, no, your service here pretty much ruined my day, but thanks for the weak attempt"
"@united what, you forgot to tell them the flight was coming... Thanks for allowing me to miss my connection"
"@united Such as deodorant, shampoo, toothpaste. Seems like that would be limited to 70oz, correct?"

@united I fly @AmericanAir normally.  This doesn't happen to me with them.  I'll let your flyers provide their own feedback. Thank you.
@united the upgrade to first class was a nice way to fix your earlier mistake. Thank you!

@united Total BS.have 1st class seats for connecting flight. Your crew Late Flight. We miss connection. Had next plane. Yet u don't honor it??
.@united too much info to share via tweet. Please send me your name and contact info. Happy to supply you with images and CS rep names.
@united once again your lack of customer service astounds me! You are the worst airline in the history of airlines! Train your staff!
@united Extremely disappointed in #Flight6831. United left crew and pssgrs stranded in rain @ gate with no cover. Left Psngrs 2 depart plane
"@united besides landing the plane, overall customer service experience has been poor. Late Flight and rude workers plus missing luggage"

@united I am not digging the new mileage earning plan. I would earn about 1/3 of the miles I do now. Any changes to the award ticket prices?
@united outsourcing ticket and gate agents at MIA. Ill advised. You did it in ROC and service went downhill. Keep employees and fliers first
@united Was just hung up on by customer service after waiting 30 min on hold...guess that vacation's not happening? Website wasn't working.
@united bad idea to let 200 people back on the terminal with food vouchers but allow only 15 minutes to get anything.  Long lines!! #ua1523
@united what's going on with the mileage plus accounts? Login through username and email have been down for at least three days.
@united what incentive do I have to give you another chance?
@united my dad booked through orbitz and due to weather he can't make it to the airport. Can you help him?

@united you get a 2nd chance today as I fly to A'dam. Let's see if you can redeem yourself after that last horrendous trip to the states.
@united Very impressed so far. An app that's worth a damn and sms updates on my flight.
@united any last minute flight deals for your cute little #frequentflyer ??? :)))) my Friday flight was Cancelled Flightled!!
@united just had the worst customer service experience ever on united airlines
@united airlines 1st &amp
"@united diverged to Burlington, Vermont. This sucks."
@united officially has the most inefficient boarding procedure. There is no reason it should take 45 mins to board a plane!
@united 3 hours of sitting in the plane that hasn't left the Gate yet. 6 more hours of actual flying left.
@united I sent my details to the customer care link you sent me almost a month ago and no response.
@united terrible service for military members and their families. #ridiculous #UnitedAirlines
@united Hi have a question re future Flight Booking Problems. DUB-JAC 29/9 JAC-LAX 8/10 LAX-DUB 13/10. I'm *G. What is checked bag allowance for JAC-LAX?

"@united if you're going to Cancelled Flight flights today, do everyone a favor and get on it now. Don't stall the inevitable."

"@united 
Flight UA1665 got delayed 2 hours due to a mechanical issue...could use a free drink or 3 to make up for this inconvenience"
@united his cell phone record needs to be checked to see who did conversed with. I trust the FAA can handle this better.
@united 15.99 for wireless?  Was 6.99 epic #fail . #greedy #piggy you are the worst!
@united have you inspected the picture? routine aircraft check while on his cell phone? What will the FAA &amp
"@united your ""Airserv"" contractors aren't worth a wet damn. 30min Late Flight, still not done w bags on UA1566. They made checkin a calamity."
@united Will never fly with you again! Terrible service!! Ruined our entire vacation!! #lostsuitcase #noreimbursement
"@united web app won't let me upgrade seats, call center wait time is 20 minutes plus, just want to get more legroom but it's a pita"
@united 132 characters does not cover my reasons I'm afraid
@united while busy on his cell phone ???
"@united really, fill out a form about my flight experience? I sent an email to the 1K email address."
"@united: ""Left gate 5 minutes early."" 
My thoughts: ""That doesn't count if you sit on the Tarmac for a half hour."" #comeonpeople"
@united will the kudos to capt. Herman be relayed to his chief pilot or should I be emailing someone?
@united on flight 1665 but it's not departing! Website says delayed due to operational difficulties-what does that mean?
"@united do you teach your gate agents 2 lie? Or do they just learn on their own? There was overhead space for my bag,  didn't have to check"

@united i booked lh via ua.  However at gate they rebooked me to a Late Flightr lh flight.  Now that flight didnt earn pqd for me.  How do i get it
@united coupled with self-service policies/cost cutting exacerbates the noted issues. (3/3)
"@united I appreciate the immediate offer, but suspect it is more long-term issue/not simple fix. Also, ski/bootbag policy is awkward at best"
"@united It isnt simple issue, generally how you set up check in/baggage policies at Logan and general unhelpfulness of employees in early AM"
@United terrible illogical re-route after Cancelled Flightled connection. Then made me pay to check bag. Then lost bag. #ual
@united I already follow you. One of you 800-number agents rebooked me. Went from a 777 to an a320. Ugh.

"@united  UA 1706 there is no way a plane ""loses its software"" I believe you decided to do an upgrade..."
@united already missed connection... UA 495

@united when a 2 hour flight turns into a 3:30 ordeal...sigh
@united where are our luggages? With a group and over 20 luggages are lost
"@united assistance with what, the attitude of your staff no matter which airport we are at?"
@united Sure.  Follow for a sec and I will.
@united Thank you so much for your help with my birthday trip! Tickets are confirmed! :-)
"@united airlines.
On flight UA 1669.
Need to make UA 3781.
Can u hold the plane for us?"
@united thank you.
@united when will I hear? Guitar was damaged in December. I use my guitar to earn a living. Get your act together!
@united I was on hold for over 20 minutes and was talking to one of your employees. I asked him for name or id # and he hung up in my face!
@united I hope so but I've received no help so far. I've been on hold for more than an hour. Can someone speak to me?
"@united tried other flight options as per weblink, non available for next 2 days, frustrating #notgoodenough #poorservice"
@united you asked me to DM then ignore them. Please assist in changing to another flight today- 21 Feb fra to mco avoiding IAD.
@united how do you stay in business with such poor service? #poorservice #notgoodenough http://t.co/VO61LME5ja
@united Will the airline refuse my Canadian passport with less than 6 months remaining validity? Going to US.
@united what time should I arrive at the airport for my 6:15 am domestic flight out of San Diego?
@United #767 taxing in at #ORD @fly2ohare @AirlineGeeks #avgeek http://t.co/uPocMmuLUN
@united I sent a DM re an existing reservation but no one has responded
@united I am going to a service desk now to see what the options are.
@united I miss the Continental days.
@united or how about next time my bag is underweight you guys credit me $200. Or how about I take my business to an airline that cares.
"@united It wasn't full, I had plenty of time to go to the gate and check, plus with my status I should have gotten on!?!"
@united Then why did your staff refuse to let ME on the earlier flight citing my having checked a bag?!?!
"@united Thanks for nothing. Next time I'll bring a whole extra suitcase for my 1 extra pound. That makes sense, right?"
"@united first you lost all my bags, now you Cancelled Flight my flight home. 30 min wait to talk to somebody #poorservice #notgoodenough"
"@united Great landing in Denver, next Rapid City. Snow starting to fall...Florida Everglades is a faint sunburn away...here comes the cold!"
@united Looking forward to flying with you guys as well !!
@united how is it that my flight #3367 can arrive early and be delayed due to no gate being available. We are now 20 min Late Flight on tarmac
"@united my flight landed 50 min, but we are being told to stay on the plane, haven't pulled up to the gate &amp; have little to no information."
"@united I have such a love hate relationship with you. Some days you're good, the others you are so terribly awful its saddening"
@united have better customer service at John Wayne airport.
@united Bag was finally delivered and intact. Thanks for your assistance.
"@united passengers seated, crew ready #WheresThePilot? Flt1088 from ORD. Hope he isn't at the bar."
@united Booked 11 tix 1 month ago and now its about $157 CHEAPER and customer service was useless. What's up with that???
@united is UA938 still taking off at 9:05pm? I'm stuck on the tarmac on UA3462 waiting to get in.
@united you're right. Good you caught the mechanical failure. Too bad there are no blankets. But ok.
@united - we're sitting in UA1088 getting delayed because the operations can't find captain. #ridiculous #united
@united truly the WORST day of flying I have ever experienced...
@united. You guys made my day. Treated me well. Thank you!!!
@united Stuck in Houston because you can't seem to get a plane to the destination on time in perfect flying conditions.
@united you phone customer service team is bad. Think it is time for me to consider switching airlines.
@united how much longer United?? Been on the phone for over an hour to straighten out a star alliance upgrade!!! http://t.co/U1ViEuiDF5
@united How can I verify if wheelchair assistance has been requested for my next flight?
I left my dildo on the plane is there any way for me to get it back? @united
"@united Don't know her last name, but Karen at your call center is terrific.  Friendly, helpful.  Terrific representative. Kudos."
@united I'm Cancelled Flighting my #mileageplus card and I will NEVER do business with you again. You clearly don't care about your customers.
"@united thank you! Good service, safe flight... 1/2 way home!"
"Why even ask me to DM you and offer help if you ""can't do anything"" @united #terriblecustomerservice #unitedairlines http://t.co/feC4i3Vwq7"
@united Yes and that is appreciated but misinformation damages credibility.  You may want to have someone observe in Newark #fwiw
@united you guys suck!
"@united never fails, flying FC order ravioli get chicken. Tell the FA she says you should of told me, other people wanted chicken..idiot."
@united second time flying into Houston and 45+ mins waiting for luggage at baggage. Typical? Still waiting..
"@united Both flights went great and improved my view of your airline, cheers! Flight attendents on UA1022 deserve a raise"
"@united again HORRIBLE service, again attitude when asked for information, again you make me not want to fly UNITED ever. #platinummember"
@united and now your rep just hung up on me after over 35 mins on hold because I asked for a supervisor. I'm furious right now.
@united I have a question about my interview process I had only one interview but was the last person is that good or bad
@united thank you for 7 hrs at terminal D in Dulles airport http://t.co/IG2dgctt2M
@united go bankrupt again and transfer all of your assets to $LUV. That would be great.
@united landing in Chicago - saw it once we were already airborne.
"@united Marcus helped me - good agent, couldn't fix it. Flight was listed on website, but ""unavailable""to book. False advertising much?"
"@united I may not hit any new status this year, but I�۪ve flown several times this year and have tried to book with y�۪all every time!"
"@united unsmiling rep. told us hotel shuttle comes ""like every 15 minutes."" Breezy 30 min. Late Flightr we're taking a cab. You going to reimburse?"
"@united If someone misses his connecting flight because of the airline, and it was the last flight of the day, how will you fix it?"
@united Yes I needed plenty of assistance but received none.
"@united not tonight, we got a hotel and after 14hrs of traveling and still not reaching our destination we are disappointed. Thanks"
@united thank you for the reply. I emailed your customer care department about my experience.
@united How can I file a claim when your agents won't let me speak to a supervisor? My claim number is expired because you WON'T find my bag
@united it's done.  If you do something to make up for it I'll tweet that too.
@united I had one interview I was the last person what does that mean?
@united I have flown with you 10 times in the last 13 days. 8 out of 10 flights have been delayed. Huge mistake on my part. Don't fly united
@united I just received notification of in-flight Wi-Fi for UA863 from @flySFO to @SydneyAirport. Amazing!
@united yes but taking two days to get bag delivered. Missed a full day skiing because of this.
@united give her the recognition she deserves!
@united she's the type of person that can make a customers day! I fly 100+ times a year &amp
@united made me remove 1 pound from my checked bag otherwise they would charge me $200. Loyal flier for 10 years - time for change.
@united been sitting on this plane 3:15 unreal. When will my 2+ day nightmare end?
@united you suck. @SouthwestAir you're the best.
@United can you let us out of the gate now. UA1157
"@united &amp; on top of no free tv on the int�۪l leg, now I�۪m sitting on the Tarmac in Houston, 70 min past departure w/ another hr plus to go"
"@united DTV doesnt work, pilots Late Flight, wont let 10yr old fly next 2 me and I paid 4 an upgrade. #unitedsucks"
"@united Your ""Loyalty Team"" basically flipped me off via phone, but thanks. Maybe Google ""loyalty"" and get back to me? ^LOL"
"Hey @united, this is your job, don't give me the safety spin. This is the same plane that broke on the original flight out. #unitedSucks"
@united Thank You
"@united, if you mean beyond opaque ""maintenance issues"", yes, that would be  basic in customer service which your EWR staff can't manage."
"@united ""Dear Ted. We don't care about you nor the Mileage Plus Card you pay a lot for. Bye bye. -- United"""
@united Terminal 1 gate B3. Flt 1299. Then take her to Terminal 5. Gate M13. Swiss Air LX009
. @united sad that you don't think it is important to resolve your client facing team that behaves disgraceful
@united Help! My girlfriend Amy Lloyd is going to miss our flt to Zurich bc of your fault. She needs a golf cart to meet her at ORD (1)
@united - #epicfail from a former gate agent in PIA!  He walked away and quit! Luckily a responsible PIA agent saved the day!
@united That was the problem.  We were being told the aircraft was on its way.
@united will do. Thx. Been sitting on plane now for 2.5 hrs and now we have to refuel!  I can't even make this stuff up.
@united do you know how to use twitter bro?  Your terminal looks like it's in Bosnia.  Here's another pic. http://t.co/M9Nywr5Kbs
@united you are by far the worst airline. 4 plane delays on 1 round trip flight. How is that possible.
@united I took care of it myself. Had to rent a car and drive 3 hours to retrieve my belongings. Due to united errors.
@united now I'll probably miss my next connection!
@united any chance you'll ever do CPUs on your JFK-LAX like @AmericanAir?
@united you may think I'm joking or blowing it out of proportion but the last 8 united flights have been delayed or significantly Late Flight.
"@united not the case. Now delayed due to ""mechanical issues with no update on departure time"". Just Cancelled Flight the goddamn flight so I go delta"
@united 2 days and 3 planes with mechanical issues?  Now over 1.5 hrs Late Flight sitting on this plane. This is insane!!
@united I didn't get a message from you. I'll resend numbers.
"@united Yes, filled out the form last year. Don't have case number handy. Guess I'm not cut out for the historical society afterall"
@United What idiot designed your seats? Armrest TV remote &amp
@united You can bump me up to Group 3 so I won't be forced to check my bag and wait 30+ minutes at LGA.
"@united Listen, learn &amp; do this: Remove your PQD requirement. It is insulting. ^HA"
@united thank you for the reply.  I will fill out the form and submit it as requested.  Good to know you're paying attention!
@united Gate Agent Alavera is amazing
@united I need you...to be a better airline. ^LOL
@united your agents forced me to check a carry on bag. When I received my bag I found your crew had stolen from me. U lost my business!
@united wins top marks for customer service via Twitter. They turned a poor experience into a positive. Many thanks for the effort! _�ԍ
@united Really....you charge me $25 to check a bag and then you put it on a different flight....still Don't have my bag!!!
@united Why haven't you released a travel advisory for IAD for tomorrow????!!!!!!!!
"@united cross country flight SFO&gt;BOS. No wifi, not even a can of soda and this quality inflight entertainment #sad http://t.co/xhlc30MTfF"
"@united is really getting horrible. So much for tucking in my kids tonight. Delta transfers miles/status, right? http://t.co/H6HN33JJJE"
@united I just had an interview how long does it take before you hear back
@united I think problem resolution should be decided on your end. Especially if you'd like me to continue flying your airline.
@united roundtrip to London on @Delta ? I think I will! FYI that's another $1k you just lost. #moneynotspentonunited #unfriendlyskies
@united already Flight Booking Problems next week's trip on @AmericanAir  thanks for making the choice so easy #disunited #unfriendlyskies #servicefail
"@United flight experiences R often frustrating, but 2day on UA5184 from CHI to WPG flight attendant April was #amazing! She's 1 of the best!"
"@united Also, group 5 is total BS."
@united Don't ask me to be patient without offering something in return.
"@united just like clockwork, Friday afternoon flights from LAS to DEN running Late Flight. Why does this seem to happen so consistently #KeepIt100"
@united I will! On @AmericanAir @SouthwestAir @Delta or @JetBlue  all of which will be getting my business. #unfriendlyskies #unbelievable
@united free booze for the Bach party would make it better!  ORD--&gt
"@united (2/2) I have their name (boarding pass was in there, too).  I think they might really need this. Any ideas?"
@united - sitting in seat 10D on a flight back from Vegas to Chicago.  Someone left a folder that looks important in the seat pocket. (1/2)
"@united incompetent/rude service today. Missed my connecting flight, then the customer service desk was terrible to me. Really upset w untd."
@united - terrible experience on UA415 on 17th. 1st exit row in economy has zero legroom. Have same row booked for return but can't change.
@united 5.5 hours Late Flightr I've been in transit for a total of twelve hours...please just change the plane on flight 600 this is ridiculous SFO
@united all good man it isn't your fault that plane is having maintenance issues
@united this delay of flight UA4636 has been painful. I sure hope it doesn't cause me or my luggage) to miss my UA82 flight to New Delhi!
@united Yes but unbelievable.  Should have a free fare lock
���@united: @BattierCCIpuppy Your puppy is so cute. We look forward to having both of you on board. Thanks for the high five. ^EY�۝ _�ԏ_�ԏ
"@united worst AIRLINE 
BEWARE THEY DO NOT MAINTAIN THERE PLAIN

"@united it should be free like other airlines! Again, it�۪s not 1997 anymore."
@united Existing reservation is fine. I was talking about no longer having an 0600 CMH-ORD option. 0638 gets me in too Late Flight.
@united please tell me I'm going to make my connecting flight from O'hare to #STL #SouthBendINWhere _٪� http://t.co/qGwK10dEwv
@united Lindsay and ??.  Darn.  Terrible memory on my part.  I know they are headed back to IAD and then PIT tonight.
"@united I know. I�۪m sure you hear it all the time ��� don�۪t like the new seats. I�۪m a small guy, 5�۪ 6�۝ and I feel the new planes are tight"
@united how about after 2.5 hrs at ORD another .5 on the tarmac + refuse to move me to an earlier flight you make it up to me? #iflyalot #bs
"@united OK, thanks for the clarification."
@united When are you coming back to @IFlyOAKland? You have a huge East Bay customer base due to SFO and *I* miss you!
@united also doesn't help me. I'm a very frequent flier and united premiere gold. Apparently that means nothing.
@united delayed another hour
@united as a million mile flier I'm embarrassed to ask how long ago his launched?
@united Can't beat the storm out of town if you wait to issue the policy until too Late Flight.  NWS issued storm warning already...
@United @Skywest do it again!   I will now miss one or probably both our Aspen events. #Fail
"@united don't need your apologies, need my bag. Took 56 minutes from landing to get it. Unacceptable."
"@united add wifi, entertainment and the old seats and i�۪ll come back."
@united so we fly into SFO and Honululu gets pushed back 3.5 hours and now it looks like more delays.  I beg of you plz sort this out soon!
@united : thanks! i will catch my conection! :)
@United super lame that you charge $8 for tv on an international flight to the US. It isn�۪t 1997!
"@united as for volunteers to give up seats, people did! Now we sit for 25 minutes on plane waiting 4 them to add more people!  #letsgo"
@united 4016 529557.   You going to transfer my car to me too?  Because it's at the airport you couldn't get me too...
"@united next time I will not volunteer to let you gate check my bag for space, since you obviously can't deliver it in a timely manner."
"@united I'm sorry it's cold in chicago, but I don't see why that means it takes 45 minutes for my priority bag to show up on the carousel."
@united how long does it take for customer feedback to respond to a complaint?
@united you are making me miss big snow in Montana. Not cool.
@united you might be the only airline not offering waivers...keep up the good fight
@united or frontier ... http://t.co/n8WiNFu6C5
@united Thank you. Any help is appreciated.
"@united FYI, went through this on similar flight last week."
@united I know where to check. My complaint is my ticket said dinner when I booked now it's changed to refreshments. Where's my refund?
@united Bag MIA since Wednesday. Still no word where it is or if we'll ever see it again. #lostluggage #frustrated
@united assume those benefits only apply to my own reservation. Any way my partner (on diff res) can use them? Can we combine res?
@united or us air: http://t.co/Eis9hcNPrO
@united we can't all be american airlines I suppose... http://t.co/0EWj7oKlji
@united Love to report how horrible this flight is to your team. Let's make it worse...as they get to my seat...out of all snacks
"@united uhuh.Group trying to get out of Nashville and into IAD today instead of tomorrow,why be preemptive though... https://t.co/yBv0xaowKv"
@united thanks for moving my dad on to my my mom's flight. You helped make his birthday start with #FriendlyFriday Awesomeness! 4 paws up!
@United you need to get it together 3 of 4 flights Cancelled Flightled stranded with no car and my baggage is lost!  You NEVER get it right.
"@united blood services, make your appt. today! 18009174929 http://t.co/6UXwPaduGS"
".@united It's worth saying that, if you litter in Singapore, you get caned. ""But there are rules"" says @united"
"@united Not waiving change fees with the snow storm coming tomorrow? IAD is under Winter Storm warning tomorrow already, what's up?"
@united yes! I'll be sending an email to customer service today.
"@united I'm fully aware, it's just that your rules are harsh toward the client. Especially since you're going to resell my seat for more $."
@united why I won't check my carry on. Watched a handler throw this bag -- miss the conveyer belt -- sat there 10 min http://t.co/lyoocx5mSH
@united why? So I can waste more of time on this airline to get an automated message? Disappointing as always.
@united this means within one week i will have filed 2 compensation complaints to your website
"@united not 100% sure, however my ticket included one checked bag, therefore this charge was extra and completely unanticipated."
���@united: @d_goodspeed We will follow up with our Maintenance team. Thanks for the tweet. ^KP�۝ THANK YOU!  United Cares!
@united Terribly disappointed. Confirmed reservation delayed and your cust. service staff was not helpful in finding an alternate solution.
@united this is for a check-in luggage. Employee told me not to include wheels in the dimensions.
@united dmangen@visualclubconcepts.com
"@united if I had a ticket refunded which I purchased, for my brother to fly...could I then used the refunded credit for me to fly? Respond"
@united this is besides the fact that one week ago you delayed me by 18 hours. i am not impressed at all.
"@united its my one and only checked bag, which is checked to edinburgh, however i am being charged randomly from dc to newark"
@united with the purchase of my ticket i am entitled to check in 1 bag however i am being charged an extra 25 dollars for domestic transport
"@united Thank U for the 1hr delay then boarding us onto a plane that reeks of vomit, flight attendant indicated it wasn't cleaned properly."
@United I have never been so grossed out in my life. What a disappointment-yet again-flying with you.
@united need to add service dog to my itinerary for tomorrow
"@united thanks for delaying my flight for an hour, and then boarding us onto a flight that REEKS of vomit because it wasn't cleaned properly"
@united just landed. Might want to check flight 304 plane from Houston. That sound was during takeoff &amp
@united I can't even look at you right now. I'll call you when I'm not so mad.
@united DM ed u the request num
"@united I requested an online refund option they denied saying the ticket was used, hope they understand the problem from your approach"
"@united Nope, still sitting at the gate!"
"@united bagage which i take to in the cabin i dont need to check-in,correct?"
@united exactly
@united the passengers waited inside the flight on the runway and returned back in o gate that should not count as a valid journey
"@united yes it is partly used, the del-ewr is used, the return flight was Cancelled Flightled due to technical glitch in operations"
@united thank you.. Appreciate the response
@united Old school ride home to LAX from Houston #flyingRetro http://t.co/6asuwx3Kv0

@united Another terrible experience with United. Discrimination. Delays. And no help from customer service #united #notimpressed
"@united Hi, we are flying into IAD tomorrow evening. Do you expect delays or Cancelled Flightlations with the snow storm?"
"@united If a business decision is made that inconveniences and possibly causes lost customers, is it a good business decision? #Cranky"
@united sent a DM just now. Thanks I am incredibly happy the fast response I got via Twitter than via customer care. Thank you
@united please provide update on UA 791. This flight has been stranded by united with no information from the crew on the plane.
@united thanks for reminding me how much easier it is to fly Southwest!  Get more agents at sfo 25!
@united perfect! That works! Thank you!
"@united That's still one day over my visa expiring on June 9, which is why I booked my flight on that day."
@united Followback so I can DM plz
@united MIA-EWR #384 _���_���_��� excellent crew. EWR-IAD #3589 _���_���_��� No crew to load bags - waiting w/ door open freezing. 20 mins past departure.
@united your customer service is crap.
@united thanks for having ground crews that are surprised when flights arrive. #beingsuckontarmacsucks!
@united mechanical issue. Looks like they got it fixed! Thanks for your concern.
@united UA1023 sitting on Tarmac at ORD when there are visibly gates open. Reassign our gate.
@united thanks
@united Usually an issue with Express our of SFO. Positive note: Mainline p.s. was enjoyable.
"@united No. SATO rebooked me. Just upset that my travel office had to fix this, and you couldn't."
@united kind of unnerving to watch the guy deicing your plane text on his phone the whole time http://t.co/QdXfT9qqT9
@united refreshes my browser right before checkout.error load message. Ticket price increased $358 in a matter of sec. DoUNotWantMyBusiness?
@united @JedediahBila Why is United voted every year as one of the worst airlines? Do enjoy that title? You should give Jedediah free passes
@united I think you should board from the back of the plane #whatstheholdup #CHItoCLE
@united On the plane but thanks! Maybe don't let so many people check in by themselves - teeming with morons.
@united Thanks...seat made for a 6 year old and a broken TV. 20 flights/year...my last on your airline.
@united UA6357 needs de-icing! Stat! We've waited our turn...
@united yes I've boarded this way many times &amp
"@united @bobwesson fair enough United. everybody is doing the best they can. Although that ""slight delay"" is turning into a Cancelled Flightlation."
@united Still waiting on our bag! Never got delivered yesterday. Can't reach a real person for help. Sending DM with ref number.
@united worst flight experience I've ever had. Will never ever fly your airline again.
@united why do I have to go thru the details of the flight I want w/ the recording to then repeat ALL when a real person gets on the line?
@united Looks like they came through. Thanks again for the help.
@united anything yet JJ?
@united why would a person take hours and hours of wait time just to tell a lie
@united hey! DM not working. UA 307!
@united the refund team is far from customer care courtesy they need training on work ethics. So it's like sir u r lying how can I help
@united splitting up my flights quadruples the price
@united contd... I am being told that I am asking for a refund on a used ticket on a flight that got Cancelled Flightled how is the ticket used?
@united after several trials and several hours of waiting on phone to contact customer care to get my refund all I get is cold shoulder
@united I booked and paid for a flight to get me to Denver at a specific time for a meeting. You failed... It wasn't caused by weather
@united since when did you get so good again!  4 transcontinental flights in 72h.  What a pleasure/relief you were.
@united what I don't understand isn't flight that I paid premium for getting Cancelled Flighted and the best you can do is next available flight...
"@united Flight is awful only one lavatory functioning, and people lining up, bumping, etc. because can't use 1st class bathroom. Ridiculous"
@united Are the current on board food menus available anywhere online?

@united appreciate the sentiment and you were able to get me off the ground
"@united I log in, view reservations, try view specific reservation &amp; takes me back to login page,"
"@united it just goes round &amp; round, it's be going on for weeks,"
Thank you @united for your prompt assistance.
@united 3 times my flight has been delayed and I miss my next flight. This time you've lost my baggage. No clean clothes. $337 flight. Thx!
@united I looked on the email chain and there is not one
@united why the hell do my miles expire? Was really looking forward to accruing enough for a free flight in 10 years.
@united thanks for more timely updates.
@united Do you also want the naming rights to my first child so I can fly home and visit with my mother and avoid more winter depression?
@united I'm familiar with the procedure. It wouldn't be the first time #UnitedAirlines lost one of my bags. #unhappytraveler
@united I get that. But doing it by giving inaccurate/misleading info doesn't seem like a great way to do it. #hopethegearmakesitintact
@united cleaning a regional jet takes an hour?

@united Thank you for your offer! All sorted out :-)
@united workin on it. Waiting on him to reply.
@united Flight 395. Rolling delay of 1 hour 42 minutes

@united I think this is the best first class I have ever gotten!!  Denver to LAX and it's wonderful!!!
@united of course not. The inflight crew was great!
"@united well played, ^LO."
@united The pilot of UA475 just landed this plane like he was gently placing us into a pile of whipped cream. Smoothest landing ever.
@united your website is a complete joke when using safari!
@united the new seats on the Canadaair regional jets just plain suck.
@united I'm in another country - please Cancelled Flight my reservation. I've booked through Swiss air
@united airlines abuse your expensive video equipment and overcharge you for the privilege http://t.co/SdyLuKR7pt via @robthecameraman
@united found the flight on @airfarewatchdog
@united that's the reply? Lol hoping that at least the new plane was maintained before the flight. _���
@united Did somebody say flight upgrade?
@united DM sent.
@united how is it tripitPro has accurate delayed dept. times and 2hours Late Flightr I hear the same from you? Just curious
"@united I can tell you. Your airline has lost mine and my families business. 
This day and age message through Twitter travels fast."
@united trying to reach him for the number. At last they have him on standbye and gave him 1 meal voucher for a potential 2 day standbye!
@united this is very disappointing. This is about customer service.
"@united boarded 6373 on time, deplaned, and now 100 minutes delay. No transparency during. Can't wait to give up my gold status for AA."

"@united Once again I am victim to the scam that is your SHIT Customer Service, this time the agent hung up on me WTF do you teach your staff"
@united flight 1219. My frustration boiled over after dealing with attendant. Her attitude was ridiculous.
@united nice to know that 3 hours of my time is worth $7.99. Free DirectTV for everyone! Ever hear of preventative maintenance?
@united that may be true however after 4 weeks matter is still unresolved and I can not get through to a supervisor or manager to help
@united obviously no one knows a darn thing around here.  What are we to do if this does not get resolved? http://t.co/Ph8QJzaPKx
"@united so going forward, I shouldn't be Flight Booking Problems Star Alliance flights through the United App?"
@united I have those notifications yet the staff on board say that is not accurate and they have no departure time.
@united I'm not know if the seats are actually narrower than other seats but they feel like it. Or maybe I'm extra bloated.
@united DM sent.  This lack if customer service is getting ridiculous.
@united delayed going home AGAIN. Getting really tired of delays.
@united a big thanks to ^MN and ^KN or patiently clarifying the United domestic world to me.
@united uh - I booked it through the UA website. Why the price change?
@united I'm rebooked. Getting home 4 hours Late Flightr then planned. What are the chances I'll ever see my bag again? #unhappytraveler
"@united United Club team is A+ &amp; got me a seat Late Flightr. Still, not sure why a last min UAL Cancelled Flightlation costs me $ yet overbooked folks get $?"
"@united will flight 5559 to YYC be providing free food when we are allowed back on board  after the ""broken lightbulb"""
@united I was not looking for the fare to be returned on the companion flight.  don't understand why an additional $200 fee was necessary.
"@united thank you so much, that helps a ton. Whoever is on this Twitter acct today deserves a handshake and a hot chocoLate Flight. #problemsolvers"
@united I left headphones in 2A on UA4689 from YHZ-EWR. It's a long shot to see them again. But worth a tweet anyway!
@united 129 thousand fans of @JedediahBila are asking you to give her your utmost effort to get her a safe flight with her baggage soon!
@united can't wait!!! 787!!! @tpallini http://t.co/oDlall5eDH
@united flight 5187 to be specific. The last two were probably 30 feet apart and within sight of each other
@united love being told you would issue a refund when you couldn't get us out of the way of a hurricane to have it denied
@united Without baggage for 5 days and can't get an update from Houston airport since Monday. Worst service ever!
@united yes to three different checkers along the walk to the plane. Overkill
@united Bummer. Might have to go with @AmericanAir card instead. TY for response though.

@united - please help regarding PNR A3ZZ0F. Why am I now waitlisted for a flight?
@united just emailed Jim Compton and Jeff Smisek so hopefully you pay attention now
@united I hope you have a solution or insurance to cover this issue
@united customer service has no solution and now we might miss a show because of them
@united deserves to go bankrupt. Just delayed an outbound flight with no info on the connecting flight that we're going to miss
@united FLT 3444 delayed because of maintenance - that's fixed but can't board because flight crew didn't stay in boarding area #fail
@united not anymore.  Finally was ticketed 5 min before takeoff.  Not sure why the confusion with a full-fare GSA ticket.
@united Do miles earned with Explorer card count toward lifetime miles?
"@united yes, but they still don't know where it is.  I've been told it might be on a flight, but now no one can confirm it."
@united what do I do if something is missing from my checked baggage?
"@United wind chill in Ithica -17 degrees, and for the trouble of losing my clothes they give me a t-shirt. I'll burn it for warmth. #united"
"@united Aw, thanks for the kind words. Totally makes these extra 6 hours sitting in an airport SOOOO much better."

@united #4781 Cancelled Flightled. #5102newflight I will be upset if this one Cancelled Flights too. I could have rented a car if they would have been honest.

@united I need a customer service manager to contact me please
@united Is flight 5001 really going to leave Newark today?  If not tell us now and I will rent a car.  I do not want to end up stranded.
.@united thanks for the reply. I saw that but it's not particularly helpful to a hungry vegetarian not flying those specific flights. SHRUG.
@united so funny that my boarding pass said PRIORITY a because clearly I am not a priority to this airline
@united I'm sure you will offer me nothing for the inconvenience you have put me through TWICE this month. Tweets don't cut it
@united or you'll Cancelled Flight my flight like you just did
@united screwing me over twice in one month. Learned my lesson. We are through.
@united what's the point of offering a free checked bag of you lose it?

"@united flight from vegas to houston Cancelled Flighted this morning ""due to operation"" what does this mean!???? Thank god I woke up early today!"
@united Will do! Thanks!
@united education of that staff is needed - he also turned away other first class cabin passengers with mileage plus.
@united Item (not mine) mysteriously ended up in my checked bag after a #EWR to #YOW flight.  Missing a black box? http://t.co/SJQEmDtQmA
@united My guess:flight is going to be Cancelled Flightled because there are 16 empty seats and those who confirmed are not important. #frustrated
"@united instead of making  seats smaller/thinner so u can jam more people on a flight,u should concentrate on maint &amp; happy customers"
@united I need assistance with pulling your agents' heads out of their asses
"@united gates were DEFINITELY NOT FULL. We were parked and wheels were chocked. Customer service called it an ""UNMET ARRIVAL""!!"
@united @abigailedge Another glitch??
@united in spite of flight delay great customer service provided by Janet and baggage employee Karen. You have 2 wonderful employees United.

@united no chance in hell. I'd rather walk. Worst airline ever.
@United is the worst major US airline.  More proof: they're boarding the plane with the outside galley door open in 0 degree weather.  Wtf?
@united [checked in + boardingpass w/no checkin bagage] guess i'm all set. :-)

@united then send your Jeff Smisek on a trip with JetBlue or SW and make sure he takes notes. I would never choose to fly United again.
@united So disappointed in the service and the level of staff communication. Such a bummer.

@united hello. I got off a flight a few months ago and constantly think about your peanuts. Is there anyway you could send me some?
@united Flt 359 lax to EWR. Your pilot bragged about getting to EWR early only to wait 20 min for a jetway driver. Thanks United!

Really? 9+hours???? @united: @JenniferWalshPR We don't like delays and do all we can to avoid them. We'll have you on your way ASAP

@united thanks for ruining my wedding anniversary. Flight UA4904 from EWR to RDU is delayed by over 3 hours and will reach home the nxt day
@united Cancelled Flightled my flight for some unknown reason and haven't really given me anything to make my overnight layover tolerable

"@united Doumented via link. However, now that it has been over four months with no response, what do you suggest? Or shall I not expect one?"
@united WHAT?! Y'all have zero concept of customer service. Oh...and now my connection is delayed too!
".@united just curious why you'd board a flight without a pilot. Seems crucial to the flight process, no?"
@united sent DM's
@united just changed again.  This is crazy! #YourAgentsHaveNoClue http://t.co/A37N3oHOKL
@united Never can get a flight out on time. 4 hour delay earlier another hour delay on my connecting flight. Makes 10 straight delays
@united b/c of your delay now you are oversold by 14 passengers?!??? This is a mess! What are you going to do to compensate?
@united - blamed weather lol 78 no wind and not a cloud in the sky!! Delayed both ways 4x!! RU kidding me to charge me for 1.5lb w/8 delays?
@united be worse?oh you can't! delayed with no reason on the way to Lon
@united flight 4841...3 gate changes on top of this.  Really hoping you can compensate with some points/mileage to my account!
@united should contact me and the others on my flight who can't get their website to work. None of our info is valid! http://t.co/3zpJr7kWbk
@united over an hour stuck and still not off the plane. Total failure by you and your partners in ensuring the best customer experience.
@United line up @iah #IAH @AirlineGeeks #avgeek http://t.co/dJHXvJT201
@united silence is very telling
@united thanks for the 2hr delay and then no ground crew when we landed. At least you didn't break my http://t.co/GCWVFuopl2
@united Bought a round trip to Chicago two days ago...today the same flight is half that! Is there any way for me to get that discount??
@united Am I illiterate or is there a magic code to make your customer service site work? http://t.co/t4gcKs2bh5
"@united worst airline ever! Staff is nasty, wifi down bags are delayed due to weather?? And now the belt is broken. Selling UAL stock in AM"
@United Stars and Bars @iah #A320 @airlineguys @AirlineGeeks #avgeek http://t.co/mWSoGUC33p
@united I'm confused. After your @Dulles_Airport agents directed us to go to your website after DELAYS nothing works! http://t.co/cypRHe5GOK

@united in Bogota with no wallet is no fun. :-(
@united Lost my wallet on flight 1007 yesterday from Houston to Bogota. Filled out your online form. No response yet.
@united one hour after departure time and still no update!
@united I am now following you and see that I am not the only one experiencing and noticing a substantial downgrade in service post merger
@united 40+ minutes waiting at the gate for the broken jetway. Different gate maybe?
@united how can you never got a flight from austin to Houston in time for a connection ever? Ever!
"@united got it right with the safety demonstration! Corporate but funny, reserved but NOT CORNY  as a��_ http://t.co/lwOtKIEKGU"
@united now sitting on the tarmac for a half hour after landing because your jetway is broken. #2daysofunitedfailures #1thingafteranother
@united look at the Twitter history - as usual service non existent
@united thanks for the reply. I have been in contact with Customer Care to get clarification on this issue.
@united I will give it a couple more weeks. Thank you.
@united make sure you make Cancelled Flighted flight baggage and upgrade fees seem like a labyrinth so that you might be able to swindle a few $ more
"@united How is this considered ""on time"" if it's arriving at destination half hour Late Flightr than scheduled? http://t.co/YMFTw1uyHr"
"@united thanks for trying to take my money without notice. In any other industry, you Cancelled Flight a service, a refund is issued. Cont��_"
@united And there is no direct phone number for status match desk? I really regret Flight Booking Problems with @united now.
@united yet again you disappoint. Sitting at IAD for UA3728 for 3.5hrs and you can't seem to know why the plane hasn't left Albany. #Fail
@united still sitting here waiting for a plane....4 hours wasted
@united thanks for the help. Wish the phone reps could be so accomidating
"@united line is just getting longer and moving slower. Lady working the counter is doing great, she just needs help. #customerservicefail"
@united an update on flight 5979 would be great!
@united wasting time at baggage claim thanks to your dfw ground crew who checked my bag in without actually checking for space #frustrated
@united what is the problem with your flights to ny today
@united flight was too heavy so had to fly BACK to Palm Springs (after being in the air for 30 mins)
@united Your boarding process sucks. You should learn from @SouthwestAir
"@united ouch, delays due to mechanical issues again QRO will have to wait! Yall seem to be falling apart #alwaysdelayed #unitedfail"
@united my fingers are crossed that they are more capable of getting baggage from point A-&gt
"@united What happened this afternoon? Huge amt of incoming planes to SFO delayed over 1-2 hours.
Frustrating!"
@united not about being on my way or impatience on my part...it's about you being untruthful and not having proper systems in place
@united can you maybe have more than 1 person working customer service desk in Houston airport? Line 3 rows deep 1 person working
"@united I'll stick with my United flight. Thanks, though. Effort is much appreciated."
"@united  Your survey is too long.  I fly a lot of segments and I'll fill it out after every trip, but not if it takes more than a minute."
@united can you you think about hiring some baggage attendants at EWR? Been waiting for bags for 1 hr. United = overcharged&amp
"@united Fair enough. I don't usually rant, but it's good to know someone's listening. :)"
@united are you telling me that you are now Cancelled Flighting my flight ??
@united would be hard to be worse than last time but I'm sure you'll give it a shot
@united Thank you for the Delta transfer. Will my bags go too?
���@united: @SonyaSloanMD Happy to have had you on board. Please share details here: http://t.co/2TrgEMteBZ ^KP�۝ Done!

@united your airline is a joke. 1 person working special services at EWR?!? Line is 15 ppl deep. GROW UP!
@united More concerned that you close a club I paid alot for at 10.  Last flight 11:15p.  The construction going on is very inconvenient.
@united perfect! Thank you!
@united care less about the person - although he walked away while I was complaining.  A man at 10p at LAX club.  More.....
@united smiling? NOT!!
"@united worst airline in the world-8 delays, gate agent loses her mind over 1.5 lbs and charges me $100 on top of the $25 I already paid!!"
@united will I make it with the delay?
@united @bwood we'd prefer everyone hear our complaints amount your airline
@united why do you bother surveying me!
@united  I'm on standby for my connecting flight. 1st on the list.  NudgeNudge I'm told there are four slots open. Save it for me.  Please.
@united worst airline ever after 70+ legs of travel I am officially done.  On time is not in their vocab.  I'm taking my premier status to A
@united looking back - never heard from anyone - I had to call and frankly got standard SOP - still think about it today

"@united keeps delaying my flight, horrible customer service"
@united has the best pilots ever Thank you guys for the great trip #thatisall
@united - I really down think downgrading the booze/food selections at the club is a good way to go.  How about you look @aircanada?
@united You guys are atrocious.  Far better service as silver on Delta than you as a platinum.  I'll be switching back to delta.
@united I will thank you!

@united ok. Can I DM you the info?
@united the best seats should be for paying customers and we should get to board first #badcustomerservice
@united this happens all the time.  United pilots are always in the exit row.  America treats there customers better than their employees.
@united yes when I got to the gate I specifically asked if there where any other seats.  Very discouraging to walk past the crew. 37d
"@united KOA-LAX should have fresh food service, right?"
@united OMG THANK U_���_���_���
@united unavailable leg that registered hours after being sold out. Only option to offer after 45min was +$400/ticket or Travelocity (2of2)
@united error message said couldn't process request at the last step after seat selection on each leg. Agent was unaware of an (1 of 2)
"@united  4348 soon going to have more wait time for a gate, in empty MSP airport than it was in flight  50 min and still counting..."
@united ... horrible wait time on 4348 to get a gate  ..shows total miss  management . Value customer time and respect thier sentiment
"@united  very disappointed by the service starting from gate operator at BOS , who was  rude in stopping a carry-on bag..."
@united your service sucks to Mexico from houston. You finally realized that snacks in1st don't work you cheap as)
@united will do. Thank you!
"@united Okay, thank you both."
"@united they had snacks available, just no fresh food...not sure what happened, but I'm sure we will grab a bite before our SFO connection"
"@united if guy on flight 1230 follows through on threat to sue because he couldn�۪t carry on 3 bags, I will defend you for free."
@united done as requested.
@united Pls post video of belligerent jerk ranting at SFO (1230) that's he's going to sue you for making him check his 3rd bag. He's a hoot!
@united ^GJ I do believe that this is hands down the worst service I've EVER experienced. Makes @comcast look amazing. #UnitedAirlines
@united please give special thanks to Aaron in Tampa office for helping me for literally two hours! He's amazing. Mission accomplished!
@united I can't tell/purchase through the website because they put us on a Lufthansa flight for the first leg.
@united Turkish Airlines rebooked us a United flight on our second leg from FRA -&gt
@united hey I left my favorite blanket on the plane bring it back home to me:-(
"@united ^GJ funny, I did and the attendant recommended me tweeting you letting you know about my subpar customer service. #RunAround"
@united followed &amp
@united I want a hotel room and a whiskey.
@united flight...gotta make this connector
@united - ok noted. All details will be DM'ed to you shortly.
@united @staralliance the B gates are very far though
"@united UA5029 from RIC, UA507 from ORD, &amp; UA423 from DEN -ALL DELAYED for non-weather issues. Way to go, youre batting 1.000! But no hotels"
@united I would have made it if you hadn't already booked me on another flight and Cancelled Flighted my original reservation.
@united @staralliance how can I book reward travel in August?? Everything is blacked out.

@united thanks
"@united yes, Thx! At 10:35 (landed at 9:20)."
@united get a clue. I am a 1K/2mm miler and that is the response you give?
@united I was only trying to get my emails. What are you talking about? What most business people expect from airline wifi
"@united we finally just arrive to Bogota, good but long flight!!"
@united it's not there we tried. It's already here in cancun just no one has delivered it
"@united what you did was illegal and a breach of contract. I will be in touch but not through your ""customer feedback"""
@united its not the way to treat your customers we had a lot of issues and it was not worth our headache we went thru
@united yes we are in EWR and it was corrected but just the fact the it was beought up for us to share rooms is unexpactable
@united Want to make my day? :) Friend is Premier &amp
@united please review and fix your baggage procedures at Dulles because it happens every week when my sister travels there on your airline
@united nothing else from you ^GJ? Where is your customer service?
@united that's of course in lax
@united ok thanks! Where are you counters located? And how Late Flight are they open?
"@united oh no, I'm rebooked, 7+ hours after my original arrival time. We can talk compensation."
@united my coworker that had the same conflict as me with the hotel issue trying to share posted on their facebook page and they erased it!!
"@united lost my parents luggage to cancun, said it would be delivered to hotel by 7PM, it is now almost 11PM"
@united then watched my connecting flight in DEN pull away from the gate only to pull into THE SAME gate. #SlapInTheFace
"@united @christinebpc ...and on some versions of the 738, row 11 has no window at all. Go ahead, check. We'll wait."
@United I'm pretty sure I've got shin splits from SPRINTING through IAH only to watch my plane pull away from the jet way...
@united well the income flight to dca to take us to ewr was delayed and it made us miss our connection to FLL so yes hotels were necessary
@united can you please stop Cancelled Flightling your flights? I am trying to get home to take two exams tomorrow. You've Cancelled Flightled 3 flights on me.
@united &amp
@united DCA-EWR Flight #4372
"@united 2 hour flight from FLL to Ewr, 1242, now waiting 1 hour plus for bags, no sign yet. What gives????"
@united was such a better airline when you were Continental. $75 service fee + $75 Flight Booking Problems fee + $25 talk to a human fee: FU!!!
@united any chance you could look into my problem from earlier?
@united this is despicable I spoke to  many diff people &amp
@united how come the crew traveling on the flight gets a better seat and I get stuck checking my bag and the crews bag got on the flight.
"@united Funny thing happened, we arrived on our flight from Denver at the same gate we are currently scheduled to depart for Sydney at! LOL!"
@united I forgot that Intl flights out of LAX don't go from Intl Terminal! Easiest re-check in ever! woo!
@united can you please tell me where United flies to from Sydney Australia - pref Asia Pac or US as I have a voucher to redeem.
"@united you can't claim ""weather"" with your hardworking crew pulling seats out of a plane! Do the right thing. But we both know you won't"
"@united you're missin the point! There was no ""weather"". You're lying! Seats was broken. But u claim ""weather"" to get out of hotels. Classy"
@united are you trying to break a world record for most delayed flights in a year?
@united I have flights that don't appear to have been applied to my MileagePlus account. Can you help?
"@united @VUSA_Australia I'm just an Aussie cowgirl lookin' for my cowboy. Take me to Fort Worth, Estelle says I'll find him there!"
"@united Okay, thank you for your help :)"
@united this is not what captain said! Your 820pm flight to San Francisco is delayed due to weather. UA1416 now departs ....#failagain
@united thanks
@united I bet @SouthwestAir doesn't turn a thirty minute delay on an original flight into a 7+ hour delayed arrive time
"@United is the best way to re-unite me with my one true love, shopping in USA's fashion capital #NewYork #unitedVUSA http://t.co/rBn7StUij1"
@United should find a way to distinguish boarding of premier members and credit card holders. Group 2 is too big!
@united final destination was booked through United but with quantas. United has not yet contacted Auckland. I am unaware of case ID number

@united Hi guys. I submitted a request for ticket/hotel reimbursement for a delayed/over night stay coming back from the Dominican. Help?
"@united Apologize to the President. Once those employees blamed him, I heard it repeated 20 times."
"@united yes, I want to complain. Your coworker was neither. Is there a customer service point airside?"
@united A change fee of $200. Same exact flight from ATL-HOU is $165. Why a charge of $574? The math doesn't add up.
@united hello. I'm overseas &amp

@united it's kinda funny. No worries.
@united My feedback and concerns via your site aren�۪t going to improve my poor airport experiences.
@united just dropped bags at Newark. Your desk guy was the rudest customer facing person I have met. Even my two children were shocked!
@united great. Looking forward to your response to my DM then
"@united It was quite enjoyable. _��_ 

Except now he's stuck on the runway in Houston. _��"
@united thank you for getting our daughter home when @americanair Cancelled Flightled all their flights to Nashville

"@united well sorta....we r trying to get to Aquadilla, PR but only 1 flight goes there a day. All are booked. UA Cancelled Flighted our flight to NJ"

@united I just sent a long note with some suggestions. Thanks for getting back to me.
@united there are at least 3 of us on UA1564 at ORD waiting to deplane to catch UA4232 to CLT. Any chance of waiting to last second for us?

@united it's almost like we're punished for living near a large metro area. EWR was top ranked for domestic delays. Not good
"@united Honestly, I stopped trying to report things via website. Now I just laugh. Flights work. Miles accrue. I'm sure it's just cosmetic."
"@united thanks. Weather is understandable, but when every single domestic flight is delayed because of inbound int'l flights, it's crazy"
"@united #1007 Houston-Bogota boarding again, safety first, it seems the mechanics fixed the problem faster, good energy to fly home/family"

@united have reported it.  Still in Istanbul at the moment apparently.  On the other plane haha.  Hats off to the pilot!
"@united, Understandable. I did try Flight Booking Problems several times for 2 passengers &amp; got the messages I mentioned before. As for the agents price???"

@united thanks! Makes sense. Just annoying that it can't be determined better.
@united patiently drinking and tweeting about my experience
@united you have yourselves to blame for giving me the time to get drunk and tell you how I feel about your overpriced sub par airline
@united idea: if u don't want us to be frustrated don't Cancelled Flight flights because your crew overflowed a toilet. Get a plumber
@united I will be patient in my luxurious middle seat on my next delayed flight
@united I will be patient as your agent explains how you have me booked on a new flight for 6:18 when that plane doesn't arrive until 6:07
@united please help trace my luggage which was put through without a name tag on 11 February 2014 at Albuquerque airport
@united be patient while I let this string of tweets go out showing people you are bad at your business
@united I think you guys had a half full flight at 4 so you held our overbooked 3pm flight to fill the other one then Cancelled Flightled mine

@united How many 787s do you currently operate and what other aircraft do you operate?
"���@united: @qlyss8 We don't want our customers to be frustrated. Thank you for your patience. ^JT�۝ A lovely sentiment, but not a $180 one."
@united 4 different departure / arrival updates for UA304??? In 1hr. Please!

@united this may be the last time I fly your airline.
"@united Is your company motto: ""I do not care!!!""  I heard several times from your employees to your clients in the past week.""  #idonotcare"

@united I had to change airports to actually get a flight out when my flight from FAY was Cancelled Flightled twice. $180 taxi ride to RDU--reimburse?
@united it's operated by united as it's a heathrow-Newark flight
@united yes of course I have.  Is this how you treat customer with no recourse?
@united I will be stunned if my bags are in Hartford with me.  The ORD ground crew only had an hour to move my bags 200 yards
"@united Can someone assist me with my DM's? Waiting 1 hour on phone, 2 hours on Twitter."

@united Thanks - it's very helpful to understand that the reduced price seats that are sold at check-in have priority over the certificates.

"@united I did not, my mind was on getting to the next flight."
@united now you've lost my bags too.  At least nobody has done anything to help out.  This is absurd.
@united What's up with the reduction in E+ on 737-900s? 1K who can no longer confirm E+.  Forget upgrades - just want legroom. #unitedfail
@united offered me a voucher to switch flights. Now voucher offer doesn�۪t exist &amp
@united when southwest did this to us -- a mechanical problem at least they gave us round trip vouchers. Will you step up to the pLate Flight too?

"@united yep, after long waiting on the phone we managed to rebook it. Hope it will be a pleasent one. Thanks for ur help."
@united Just had the worst experience ever flying with you
@United UA1740. As the inbound flight dep time gets closer you push it back 15 min. You've been doing this for 2 hrs.
@united why is my flight from mke to ord getting delayed? Our gate attendant is not communicating!

@united your overall experience of flying is not friendly

@united annnnddddd I'm going to lose my first class seat on the flight they shuffle me to
@united you have the nicest gate attendant at Newark airport gate 101 right now. Multiple delays and she is still pleasant with everyone.

"@united (2/2) It suggests that if can't confirm cert at time of Flight Booking Problems, I should assume that it may never clear. Didn't used to be that way"
"@united Thanks for explanation. It seems like an odd incentive structure, tho, because it dramatically diminishes the value of the certs."

1/2 @united Just be honest with your customers. The new seats are designed to fit more rows on the plane. More rows = more money.
@united missing this wedding because of these delays would not be cool
@united Designed to deter people from forgetting things or to provide more storage space? The article says the latter #unfriendlyskies
"@united what do you think missing meetings is worth?  A flight voucher?  I fly all the time, so what would make it right?"
"@United and @DirectTV. Not to pile on, but it's time to update your in flight TV package. http://t.co/Lug4MFVWsA"
@united  why is it so hard to add in meal preferences AFTER I booked tickets? I forgot to do it &amp
@united it's amazing really.

@united if I have credit from a flight I Cancelled Flightled does the new flt have to be booked by 1 yr from orig purchase date or flown by that date?

"@united even with the multiplier the ticket price will still never equal the amount of miles you travel, even for transatlantic flights!"
"@united missed connection, wrong city, bags at Palm Springs, but not at hotel. I am seriously tired of being treated this way."
@united Where are my bags!!!  They weren't in LAX like your promised.  9 out of 10 things today were a mess today because of you.
@united dang... I thought I was in a teleportation device! Ua514
@united received my bag. I appreciate taking care of the matter and following up!
@united still haven't received a response. Please direct message me for my contact information.

@united Hello. Just wondering how long it might take for Turkish Airlines flights to show up in my United miles. Thanks.
@united do you guys have any working planes?
@united we just almost had a major accident on ua3710 ... How about passing on some information to those of us waiting on plane!!!
"@united again, you said to go take the time to go there, knowing what the issue was, and knowing you won�۪t fix it."
@united 3 hour delay plus a jetway that won't move. This biz traveler is never flying u again!
@united my son is a passenger on flight 3710 from Chicago to Toronto. The plane came within feet of colliding  another plane and is stopped.
"@united That made me so mad, but then I called the bag number, and that person was helpful and told me where the bag really was. (2/2)"
"@united Yes. It was the airport person who told me the bag was still in Nashville, when I filed the claim. (1/2)"
@united The only thing you fella have done right today is get me to the pacific time zone.
@united Ugh.  My bags were sent to Palm Springs and not to LAX as promised.  They better be at the hotel when I get there.
"@united Direct Messaged you, didn't hear anything back"
"@united yup, it just happens way too often...5 times in the last 12 months"
"@united Great, thank you!! I'll send it now."
@united so who does handle bag issues? And why wouldn't you put me onto them in the first place?
@united big up the pilot of 644 for turning 1hr on the tarmac to just a 20min delayed arrival
@united returned from vacation + went to luggage services. Golf bag was presented in clear wrap that could've been used in the first place.
@united Holiday of a lifetime to New York ruined because you lost my luggage and have failed to find it since Sunday! #wontflyagainwithyou

"@united My wife has been on the phone several times for past 3 days, with no result."
@united so you are saying that customer care does not report to anyone? Their response is humiliating for a company that serves the public.
"@united #unitedairlines so my feedback is for your benefit, not for you to correct your atrocious customer service? Good to know"
@united #UnitedAirlines fill out form and never receive response? I expect remedy. We can travel another airline and Cancelled Flight as members w u.
"@united 12/13EWR-LAX UA1151 my seat/armrest broken discover after takeoff. flight full.FA filed report, who to chat with for partial refund?"

@united then why do you bother responding? Your customer service is THE WORST. Never using you guys again.
@united 618 was flight out of Houston
@united free hotel doesn't make up for such poor customer service and disregard
@united it's messed up to refuse to wait 10 min after united is at fault for delay but to leave early is absolutely disgusting.
@united mechanical delay occurred in Houston earlier today re: their flight to ORD

@united note: they are traveling w 2yr old. Unreal
@united and that plane was staying overnight at the next airport - ROC. U can make up 10 min in air but instead of waiting u leave EARLY
@united and they were traveling as guests of a mileage plus member using that members miles. Great customer service.

"@united my flight was at 1 pm. Still at the airport gee what service.  Do they care, nope.  Delayed until 7:55."
@united very disappointed in CC. Purchased ticket online w/ voucher and charge full amnt. Would not hold price after refund. Unacceptable
@united exactly it states a secure document is a nexus card. It does not state a passport must always be also presented. Read it
"@united We were told by United to ""carry over/carry back"" for the refund."
"@united no, I had to leave for work. Would have not been possible. So I would love to have this replaced now"
I feel completely cheated @united. I read your commitment to customer service via website and def did not get service suggested there.
"@united @annricord 0162431184663.
3 of your agents said we would be refunded. Agents said United should never have sold us the ticket."
@united if your air traffic crew could get their shit together no one would notice the rudeness of the ground staff

@united can I get some help changing a ticket.  40 minutes on hold and counting....
@united thanks for all the help! Totally appreciate it and you made it super easy too
@united was told by Supervisor that United disconnected their customer support # so there was nobody to address it now. #igiveup
@united Your MileagePlus signup page is broken.
@united $7 for wifi just so I can tell my family I'm gonna be Late Flight cause i had to sit in a grounded plane for the past two hours...
@united FYI: continuous texts and emails I am getting about the delay while held captive on the tarmac are not that helpful.
"@united so, not only were you Late Flight, you broke my luggage handle. You paying for a new one? http://t.co/nYVV1X3d67"
@united: No friendly skies from you today. 5hr+ weather delay in SFO followed by 1hr+ mechanical delay while sitting on plane. #NoFun
@united once again your customer service rep was rude!   I asked a question and in turn got attitude.  Jane was no help.  Disgusted again!
@united can you not see the thread?
@united poor old United: never seem to get the response right :)
@united obviously the staff at EWR - United or otherwise have not seen your ads about - being FRIENDLY and helpful #ewr worst airport
@united also why can't I pre-select seats on SFO-&gt
@united does forelock guarantee the fare only or fare &amp
@united thanks! :)
"Hypocrisy RT @united @gg8929 I'm sorry, we're not able to offer a full refund because the exchange rate is not what you were hoping for. ^KP"
@united I shouldn't have to spend my own $$$ on a hotel because of a weather delay. The weather being something COMPLETELY OUT OF MY CONTROL
@united  eventually.  You should approach bags like @AlaskaAir  they get it.
@united What if my NYC flight is delayed and I miss my connection to Sacramento from Chicago?
@united said they would give us a refund. 30 days Late Flightr NO refund.
@united how can you not know the weight of our plane after us sitting on the plane for 2.5 hrs? Not convinced your company is safe for flt.
@united we showed up to our flight several hours early. Tried to call &amp
"@united if your policy changed, you must advise at the time of purchase.  Same if you choose to vary it by airport!  We want a FULL refund!!"
"@united wanted to, but you Cancelled Flightled my tickets.... They were too special i guess even for united."
@united I'm 0/3 for Flight Booking Problems without major problems. 0% isn't bad!_��__��_
@united @el_ingeniero don't check your baggage if you don't have to.  They will lose it!
@United I'm hoping we don't miss our LAX - ITO connection. Not looking forward to being stuck at LAX overnight with our team....AGAIN!
@united well perhaps you could highlight where that is stated.  We travel between Canada &amp
"@united how can you not know, after two hours of us sitting on the plane with no bags off loaded, the planes weight?!"
@united You make it hard to fly with you. Delayed over an hour and now the plane  is turning around &amp
@united  Serious firing needs to happen at HNL. They broke the wheelchair you loaned me after you broke mine! http://t.co/bT37KyrByJ
"@united Call customer service and of course they just say ""theres nothing we can do"" and then offer a transfer and disconnect the line."
"@united Now submitted for the third time, please check and confirm receipt. Have taken screen shots in case it disappears again. Thanks"
@united if our already rescheduled flight is Cancelled Flightled is our hotel room paid for?
@united Classic
@united Elizabeth at Washington Dulles just hooked me up with a new connecting flight at my gate! I'm super pleased!
@united Thanks!
"@united Does the economy plus cabin also qualifies as a ""premium"" cabin?"
@united flight UA3364 been sitting on tarmac for 30 mins with no report as to why...any input?
@united A 3rd party service you use to sell your tickets has ripped me off. Excellent service United is offering.
@united no thanks
"@united Yesterday, I'm sorted now."
"@united thanks for that advice, so helpful. Can't believe you guys actually charge people to ""fly"" united"
@united If you have had any issues with  United Airlines PLEASE retweet. Paid for a full fight ticket and was given a standby instead.
@united just tried to log in and was told e-mail log in not currently available
@united @gg8929 so why did you Cancelled Flight tickets for thousands of people when you didn't like the exchange rate? #doublestandards
@united do you have an e-mail address I can write my account to? Might be less likely to disappear
"@united so I wasted 40mins filling in 2 online forms you are telling me you didn't receive, how do I know this won't happen this time?"
"@united 877 from amsterdam to ewr, 02.27.2015, 737-300."
@united stuck here in IAH waiting on flight 253 to Honolulu for 7 hours due to maintenance issues. Could we have gotten a new plane!?!? Fail
@united @UnitedAppeals @gg8929 What kind of hypocrisy is that? Only Cancelled Flightling tickets with bad exchange rate if in your advantage #united
@united No. The entire problem here is that I was never sent anything via email and only given a Flight Booking Problems number over the phone.
@united calling that number was useless. Heading to the airport now to pick up my bags. this whole situation seems like a real joke.
@united They couldn't get me first class on any of their flights so I just rebooked myself.
@united but the gate agent and club staff got me priority standby for next so might only be minor disaster...#travelingwithsmallkids
@united I'll be sending/posting complete details of the circumstances surrounding this matter.  United airlines should be ashamed.
@United Hidden City forces me into crappy seat even though exit row is available on the first leg. Your support cannot fix. :-(
@united JT thanks for your help I�۪ll complete the form once we are back home
"@united missed it.  Incoming on time, then Sat for 30, then no jetbridge driver...missed a 45min connection from an on time flight..."
@united @gg8929 Ladies and gents - United Airlines...
@united You might be dealing with frustrated passenegers. hope you all have a great day :) thank you very much for an amazing airline :)
@united Allright! Last question : the power outlets on my flight are available in the premium cabin. Does that include economy plus cabin?
"@united Well, It's LA and then a 2hr+ car ride to a dark Palm Springs technically. Maybe I'll get bumped to 1st class Den to PHL on Friday:)"
@united yes still need assistance I don't have a flight home due to change in flight u made I miss all connections !
@united I believe you have to follow me in order for me send you a DM
@united thanks! We would like an apology and a full refund. Please confirm when we will receive.
"@united Hi, can you email me here so i can share the details? Thanks. frank@postsecret.com"
@united But I got a bad exchange rate so want my money back. Please can you refund without penalty.
"@united My flight UA1159 to Denver for #RMOUG15 has been re-cheduled 5 times.
If I am no show, you'll know why! Ridiculous."
@united you're just using automated  responses and don't have the decency to actually care/respond
@united JT the issue is with missed connections early gate closings and zero concern from customer service
"@united here I was thinking how I could say so many nice things after getting upgraded, but then you delayed my flight... It's ok!"
@united Can you explain how it rewards us elite Premiere 1K members?
@united for our birthdays my fianc̩ &amp
@united I�۪m resending the confirmation code in a DM
@united I did DM the details back on 02/14 when this started with phone number to reach me no reply either online or by phone
@United Airlines' CEO Jeff Smisek: Disloyal to Loyal Workers http://t.co/0cevY3P42b via @HuffPostBiz
"@united The guidelines say 10x9x17, my bag is 20x15.7x8.7, so it's a bit taller than the guidelines. Is that gonna be a problem?"
@united thank you! I wish the lady in Little Rock had told me that in the morning when I asked her
@united no claim number. Haven't been back to iAd baggage since. Is there a phone I can call to speak to someone?
"@united do you think there Will problems at Newark, NJ on Saturday due to expected snow?"
@united Got it.  I am following the United page.
"@united Thank you for the speedy response! I figured it may be something of that nature. You guys and your ""fine print,"" haha"
@united worst service ever _���
@united thanks for your attention. I would actually like to make a specific complaint about customer service at DCA. What is my best option?
@united can't believe United can't find someone to just simply check a seat back for a missing passport. Loved United but debating choice
@united I am furious.  You're firm is a disgrace. Despite all our efforts you did zero to protect our daughter. All alone at night # United
@united holy high speed internet batman!  Speeds at United Club at IAD are insanely fast!  Thanks
@united Your website Flight Booking Problems experience is an obnoxious upsell-laden disaster for anyone with half a brain.
@united  @MrAndyEp like 2 weeks after my flight!?!? Creative!
@united Flt 4487 is having some MAJOR delays bc ground crew was so SLOW. The flight crew has been terrific. Been 2 hours on the ground.._���...
"@united sorry, I hate united. i won't get to see my family until Thursday"
@united Thanks for the timely service &amp
"@united done just now, thanks."
@united Currently on standby to Lax then it is a 2 hour ride to Palm Springs. Long day starting at a snowy 3:30 am in philly.
"@United Your customer service for Mileage Plus customers is a disgrace. I just spent 45 min on the phone to reset a pin number, with no luck"
"@united No, I do not. I was only given a Flight Booking Problems reference number."
@united All these changes. Way to stick it to your Premiere 1K loyal customers. Why make things harder for those that loyal to you?
"@united thanks for the offer, but I finally made it to my destination, albeit hours Late Flight."
@United Airlines Cancelled Flights OC FLL #flight today. $700 to switch. No notice no apology. We are done flying #UnitedAirlines.
@united can you send me another confirmation email?
@united it would be super if you paid as much attention to actual fliers as you do to credit card holders.
@united I travel a lot and I get it. You're still my fave but EWR to Cleveland w/40 min layover to connect to DC = our best option? Come on.
"@united 3pm and my bags still not here. not even a courtesy toiletries kit. not the flight experience I was expecting, very disappointed."
@United Airlines Cancelled Flights OC FLL #flight today. $700 to switch. No notice no apology. Done flying #UnitedAirlines.
"@united sorry, wrong link for the bag : http://t.co/pZAl4wtrEZ Thats the one i meant"
"@united flight 86 LAX-IAD, back rows NOT CLEANED prior to boarding. How gross is that to find used tissues in your seat?  Please."
@united thank you! _��_
"@united take a lesson from @VirginAmerica , they know how to treat customers!"
@united plus you horrible seating and poor customer service everywhere I've flown. now you take away the mileage program..horrible
@united you'd learn if you listen to your customers...you do want you want...@VirginAmerica asks their customer what they want
@united customer service _��_
@united Priceless. United stranded my daughter at O'Hare. United did zero to keep her safe.....alone on a plastic chair for 9h! # United Air
"@united Hi again, any updates here?"
@united Could you tell me if this bag would be accepted as a personal item ? Can i bring one carry-on bag plus this? http://t.co/U390cZpLHl
@united 3359 which you finally Cancelled Flightled.
.@united what link? Those are all the email offers u sent me in a year to buy/transfer miles.The last 1 just expired http://t.co/ZZPs5ywVE2
@united thanks finally made it.. Missed meetings but what can I do now?
@united Our flight was originally supposed to leave at 1:40pm &amp
"@united Supposedly, they're out for delivery. I'll believe it when I see it."
"@united Thank you. Yes, I was hoping to speak with someone directly, but appreciate the link nonetheless. :)"
@united Sure did! Only waited about 15min. Yay!
"@united Hi JH, my experience with United has been entirely disgusting but yes, I'd like assistance in getting compensated for my bag."
@united took this picture on Thursday. #awesome http://t.co/IVGpZSjtkW
@united probably wouldn't be doing it had someone returned my call or email. Case number 8273993
"@united I can't even fit my name on the first two lines, yes... Please do pass on feedback. This is a big downgrade from previous years."
Is expiring the @united offer to buy or transfer #United #MileagePlus miles with discount? Many offers during a year http://t.co/6tz6imqZlG
"@united no, it was 2 flight Cancelled Flightlations (one due to weather, one mechanical) paid own hotel, bag held in transfer. No voucher/compensation"
@united i got email that my reservations got Cancelled Flightled and i will be refunded.  Nothing got refunded as of yet
@united So what do you offer now that my flight was Cancelled Flighted and I'm stranded away from home and work?
@united you are really trying me today.
@united looks like I'm settled in to where I'm going.  Thx.
@united flt 4567 has had two more updates in the last 3 minutes.
@united no they were to busy taking to each other and I needed to get to an audition.
@united was never given one
@united quick response offering assistance but lack of follow through - not really the service I was expecting
@united Stuck in IAD going on 6 hours waiting for a ferry flight from Nashville that u can't tell when it will arrive?!! Ridiculous!!
"@united flt 4567 no gate agent, no announcements. So unprofessional. Time to go back to @Delta"
"@united Thanks, ^KP. Please also mention the Quiche breakfast and Tandoori chicken dinner entrees and accompaniments are truly First Class."
@united flt. 4567 departure time has changed five times in the last 20 minutes. Why don't you figure out a solution and announce once?
@united bags are still in Houston since Friday and still have not been reimbursed the baggage fee.
@united who can tell me where they are?
"@united flight 4567 have already been Cancelled Flightled once, been trying to get home two days. Staff being very unhelpful."
@united each flight is worse than last! flight attendants don't even know whether the plane is equipped with power outlets at the seats!
@united flight 4567 agent now wandered off. Pilots came out looking for her. Went to charge her personal phone which she'd been txting on
@united waiting for flight 4567 to memphis. Incredibly rude gate agent waited until after departure time to announce delay. (1 of 2) #rude
@united I don't see how I need to spend an extra $100 bc of ur equipment failure.
@united I don't need to make any changes. I reserved my seats when I bought my tickets and there was an error &amp
@united its 2015 and no power outlets at the seats on a 6 hour flight to California? Seriously? This is why airlines are failing!! Pathetic!
@united thanks kp but luckily my transfer has maintenance issues and is still delayed so I didn't miss my transfer...
"@united No, not received any e-mails in either Inbox or junk/spam"
@united - could you please send me a phone # to the refunds department?  We have submitted our claim through email without success.
"@united I'm not this person, but I've been sitting in Denver for three hours and all I want to do is get on a plane. Please let me go home."
@united  flight 441 on 2/4 was delayed over three hours because the pilot never showed up!
@united I just need to get to RIC tonight. I've been in EWR for 24hrs now.
@united which is why my next flights to Miami will be on another airline.
@united It is super frustrating that the folks at the United Ticket Counter in Pittsburg aren't honoring their own Media Rate! #unitedfail
@united 45 minutes after arrival and no bags for most people. UA469 from den to ewr. How long should we wait until a ual rep comes here?
@united What is the policy behind changing passengers' seating assignments at the gate?
@united with Karen and found her unhelpful and rude  called United at the time &amp
"@united she has crossed 4 prior times with other carriers and no issue. Karen was rude, untrained and unhelpful I also spoke"
"@united nexus confirmed that at any crossing via air, car or boat she can travel with only Nexus."
@united 2 employee yelled at her. 3 employee stood with others whispering and pointing at her from behind counter
@united 1 refused boarding with Nexus. nexus confirmed she should not be refused
"@united on a good note, the 2 employees I encountered @ Newark were fabulous. I was very Late Flight for my connecting flight and they got me on!!!"
@united u lost my bag and would not refund my bag fee? Does that make sense to you? And yes I already called cust svc. They said no.
@United yall tried it with this little bitty plane flying out of boston!! I hate little planes!!!
"@united doing a good thing, holding flight for a few for 11 peeps on Late Flight connecting flight. We'll still make destination on time"
@united Q: Just purchased ticket to #Hawaii for trip in Late Flight-March. Does this mean we will acquire miles based on price or distance flown?
@united stay warm - I will be passing through Chicago next week
@united the refund request functionality on http://t.co/5IMDckODfx is broken.i get a time out error.
@united @NY_NJairports Only at Newark can you land 15 minutes early but lose all that time waiting on tarmac for a gate.
@united giving up on your direct flight from IAH to Honolulu. 3rd attempt in 3 years - 3rd delay.  $7 meal voucher. Wow. Customer service!
"@United just played the Most bizarre ""safety"" video I've ever seen... http://t.co/Hlm2Oks6xl"
@united Nearly 48 hours Late Flightr and still no idea where it is. I will never fly United again if I can help it.
@united 1591 had wi-fi broken on plane. Had same outage on 1618 on Friday. How can Southwest get it right on every plane but United can't?
@United WiFi onboard 737-800 far superior in pricing and performance (user-perceived bandwidth and Late Flightncy) to recent @GoGo experiences.
@united Second day &amp
@united Is there a direct number to call to request a refund?  Its telling me its not valid as I changed the ticket.  No number on site
@united when is my plane coming?  Been delayed for almost 7 hours. No plane.
@united Not fast enough.  No excuse for service between big hubs to have such outdated craft. Southwest has wifi. This is awful.
@united thankful for great service in Newark. Seats fixed and I was seated with my daughter! Fab landing in Fort Myers!
@united my mother's flight was delayed from phl-ord. We're on our way to NRT and the gate refused to upgrade. A platinum.  Blegh
@united is Late Flight again.  Everyone braved the weather and 40 passengers are waiting for a flight crew.  Really!
@united Miserable trip ... lost bag Sat... found Mon... lost again... shipping 2nd day ground Tues... might have it for return flight home
@united spending the afternoon @ Mia. Not your fault.  No lounge? Very inconvenient.
@united costumer service sucks! Waiting for a week for a response
"@united Is there a way to get  a copy of Feb's edition of Hemisphere
magazine with out flying?"
@united I somehow think I'm going to be stuck paying for a hotel room in Denver without winter clothes on my dime.  I guess we'll see.
"@united I normally ask people to put on headphones...but not toddlers. Maybe planes should have a ""kid"" section (near the back) ;)"
@united of course I need help.  I've been DMing you ladies and gents all day. Your only solution is hope for the best and LAX.
@united Confirmation number: NJV4BP - All I need is email confirmation of flight from NYC - SFO Feb 4

@united thank you!!!!! And next flight to Durango then driving to Farmington New Mexico for work! But hitting the slopes in Durango!
"@united I was denied use of a rear facing car seat on UA5025, an ERJ145. Can you confirm the actual policy?"
"@united you better hold my flight to Tucson #5237, just landed in Houston after an hour delay for some minor computer problem"
Thx! Stand by! ���@united: @rajuchinthala I know it's frustrating and I do appreciate your patience while we try to get you on your way. ^JH�۝
"@united roundtrip tickets to NJ are DRAMATICALLY cheaper through Virgin, pretty pricey via United. Can you match them?"
"@united dropped off a luggage at IAD over 2 months ago for repair from damages haven't heard anything about it since, when do I get it back?"
@united that's what I thought! Thanks for the clarification!
@united feck guys. Stop Cancelled Flightling flights from EWR to RIC the weather is fine I both locations!!!
"@united + UA has been rolling out improvements too, we think. Hoping they'll catch up soon? Meantime, ANA is our preference!"
"@united @FlyANA_official pleasantly surprised to find ANA has made major upgrades on their transpacific route in flights, planes and service"
@united Step 1: Cancelled Flight flight. Step 2: Don't notify customer. Step 3: Charge them for food while they try to survive their wait. Brilliant.
@united i need my confirmation number! Can you give it to me?
"@united + besides, no small degree of self-interest. We take that route several times a year &amp; would hate to be in that situation."
.@united we rebooked. But @casleah and I had to split up and take different flights because a pilot ran out of hours? Frustrating.
"@united no worries about the tweets. We all should do what we can to make sure we, as in your tag line, ""Fly the Friendly Skies."""
@united @jsumiyasu I am thankful to the  United ground staff who put me in the last seat on the last flight out. Home Late Flight is still home!
@united I appreciate the follow up.
@united + that's the gist of what the flight attendant told her.
@united BTW is it true you have to remind flight staff after checking in even after indicating meal prefer on your reservation? +
"@united +what took me aback was the response by the flight attendant, who put the responsibility squarely back on passenger's shoulders. +"
@united No but u cld explain how such a disorganized and inefficient company w surly and obviously unhappy employees stays in business.
@united sat at airport for 5 hrs still sitting at gate..  Sigh
@united actually we did not consider she might have made a mistake. She did not complain beyond that she indicated it on her reservation.
@united Gold Star for united- change my flight- miss all connections- but can't accommodate me until a MUCH Late Flightr arrival time-Not HAPPY!

@united why am i mot getting my refund?
.@united nothing apparently. I've flown w/ you 4 times in last 3 weeks and 3 of those experiences (incl today) were clusterfucks.
@united didn't get her name. She was not in our group. She was sitting behind us. Think it was window seat #40? We only overheard...
@united You know what the United Club needs? Power. MOAR power. Insufficient outlets for the #RoadWarrior (ORD)
@united THRILLED to have my carry-on checked against my will by two nasty gate agents only to see an entire empty bin when I boarded last...
@united what if business as usual meant dropping the bully mentality and fostering inspiration for a greater business #EmployeeRelations
"@United - Ridiculous to fly outdated 757s anywhere much less btwn IAH and SFO. No power ports, no  Wifi, no personal entertainment. TORTURE"
@united last night we waited forever at the gate because someone from corporate dispatch FORGOT to call the crew #unfriendlyskies
"@united Broken entertainment system on my 8 hour NYC flight, terrible cabin crew service and online complaint form won't work #hopeless"

"@SouthwestAir yes, thank you. Just sent DM."
@SouthwestAir when is the last chance to get #DestinationDragons tickets? I would die of happiness if I won _��__٪�
@SouthwestAir The in-browser hover over is intrusive and annoying. And the fact that the WiFi only works on one device is sort of sad.
"@SouthwestAir the sign in screen had major mobile issues, the responsive design wasn't working properly my Nexus 5."
@SouthwestAir sure did. Also read on there that Southwest doesn't believe it is liable for the incident. How is it my fault that SW lost it?
@SouthwestAir What's up with the new in-flight WiFi service? Super crappy user experience. Miss the old provider. :(
@SouthwestAir it's too damn cold to be sitting on this runway with no heat!!!!!
@SouthwestAir Can you please follow so I can DM? Thx!

"@SouthwestAir now we have to wait, and wait to get it straight. I fly you for personal and business. But now, not so sure. #BeBetter"
@SouthwestAir because your gate attendant let someone board whose boarding pass kept reading invalid. This messed up the passenger log.
@SouthwestAir Your #Android Wi-Fi experience is terrible! $8 is a ripoff! I can't get to @NASCAR or MRN for @DISupdates #BudweiserDuels

"@SouthwestAir, what do you know? Finally lined up like cattle to board my SW flight (after original departure time) #badcustomerservice"

@SouthwestAir please do something about the speed of your WiFi connections on your planes.  It might as well be non-existent.
@SouthwestAir Your crew on 4028 tonight was outstanding. God bless them and the medically trained passengers on board.
@SouthwestAir Weather seriously cannot even be the only excuse at this point because it was awful service in the summer too. Over it.
@SouthwestAir is seriously THE WORST. I don't remember the last time I or someone I knew had a flight that wasn't delayed / Cancelled Flightled / etc!
@SouthwestAir Is there any way to get entry to the Las Vegas event to see @Imaginedragons perform? #DestinationDragons
@SouthwestAir...give the crew of SWA 4007 a high five from this AV-8B guy for its nice XW landing into @bostonlogan. Nicely done!

"@SouthwestAir Therefore, since I've received no recourse through phone I have submitted an email complaint &amp; a letter via mail will follow."
@SouthwestAir I consider myself a loyal customer to the brand but I'm astounded at the lack of concern about customer's flying experiences.

@SouthwestAir   Yes. Dale at Baggage office was wonderful. But not everyone is on the same page down there... We had a 6 hour wait!
@SouthwestAir No one wants to commit to saying if this plane is getting Cancelled Flighted or not. Customer relations is closed. Patience gone.

@JetBlue - Definitely no note from whoever stole from me.
@JetBlue but the 4 hour policy- when I called and they said I didn't report it soon enough. What would have changed if I had noticed sooner?
@JetBlue - Hopefully that will help someone in the future. Would there have been a different procedure if I had discovered the theft sooner?
@JetBlue - I did that as soon as I realized. Will they try to figure out who is stealing from people's bags? Security cameras? Anything?
"@JetBlue - I did, but since I was stranded in SYR without a ride I missed the window of opportunity to have rights in this matter. (4 hours)"

@JetBlue your gif game is strong.
@JetBlue well but for now the only thng we can do is wait for someone to explain us the situation with responsibility http://t.co/ML1JaCpmch
@JetBlue flight 98 DEN to JFK already 2hrs delayed. Any idea how that might change again due to weather forecast etc?
@JetBlue Why close prechk at 8PM on a Sunday at JFK?  #annoying
@JetBlue your crew didn't say it was about safety. If they say that I was glad to stay ... Check the information you give to the costumers
@JetBlue you quite possibly ruined my entire first day in South Florida bc of your disorganization. #GetItTogether
@JetBlue I'm going to write a post on @Medium about the experience. Your customer service has tanked. #JetBlue
@JetBlue Still no response from CEO. I guess he is at the Oscars.  I bet his flight was on time.  #JUSTWRONG
"@JetBlue okay. Names of SJ crew are Alamo, Tatiana. Keep telling me to hold, then leave desk. Ali told me he couldn't help bc going on break"
"@JetBlue aha, ok. Thanks! Was worried there might not be a seat at all :) Will do it at the airport tomorrow then!"
@JetBlue that is a stock response. Delays not as frustrating as poor cust serv &amp
@JetBlue Ricoh Smith at BOS provided oust and service
@JetBlue 4 hr delay on flight to JFK via Tampa &amp
@JetBlue just please get my luggage from #2070 onto carousel 5 / Logan Airport and I'll be able to go home!
@JetBlue what happens when I have a confirmed flight but no seat available during online checkin except for Even More Space upgrades?
@JetBlue thanks for the response. Just been waiting for 5 hours and really frustrated. Seems like no one at JetBlue is concerned.
@JetBlue Tx for the info. Just don't understand why you couldn't accurately estimate departure time earlier. Weather in ny is fine now.
@JetBlue hey me and my family have questions on a trip to Disney world that we are doing in April . Please follow me so I could dm you guys
���@JetBlue: @FinleyBklynCFS So glad to hear. Thanks for sharing the video.�۝ Me and JetBlue are #BFF _٪�
@JetBlue no m'good. Just get me home
@JetBlue thanks for the response. We are hopeful.
@JetBlue Update please on why flight 2601 continues to be further delayed
"@JetBlue ok, tx. Will tell the guy sitting next to me at the gate"
@JetBlue thank you for not even coming with a solution. Great service I might say...as a TrueBlue member I am totally dissatisfied...thanks
@JetBlue all day
@JetBlue how about free wifi on flt 1254 out of PBI to make up for 2.5 hr delay? Treat us right.
@JetBlue why is flight 1106 delayed out to NY? Same problem?
@JetBlue Is that a guarantee? We'll see about that tomorrow morning when I have to fight for a seat.
@JetBlue thanks for the update. 'Preciate it. Hope it gets here. Been delayed 2 days getting back
@JetBlue yes. They are working on it. Hoping bag is on the next flight and will deliver home...
@JetBlue WELL...my paid tickets have NO assigned seats at all. So essentially I won't be on this flight unless I pay more.
@JetBlue If seats aren't guaranteed why do we pay for them? when I called the rep said some other people booked our seats.
@JetBlue thank you for the refund of the change fee for a recent flight affected by our bizarre winter. Excellent customer service and focus
"@JetBlue yes, please get me the seats we paid for."
@JetBlue Flight 136 departs 2:14 AM  Finally!!!  Arrived JFK with no psgrs at 5:39 PM.  That's a long flight. AKA BUS http://t.co/KfKjF1ZtGi
@JetBlue thanks for help. Can't wait to travel with! And get out of the snow.
@JetBlue Help - I left my Nikon camera under the seat in front of me. What do I do?
"@JetBlue I hope your customer service reps are as reliable/friendly as they usually are, so far you are not living up to your + rep/exper."
@jetblue the man with the smell left nd now there's this stupid girl asking me questions. can yall help.
"FYI, @JetBlue: The last email response - ""we undrstnd this wasnt best 4 you"" -but hope 2 wlcm u back onbrd N the future...   nice touch. lol"
@JetBlue I think I have it selected already ���
"@JetBlue last flight was Cancelled Flightled, then it was 2 hours to change a light bulb, now sitting here waiting for maintenance. Unreal."
@JetBlue thanks for answering my questions!
@JetBlue that wasn't delayed or cabcelled
@JetBlue I have to say that JetBlue has officially lost a customer. What a waste of all the points I have too! I am yet to be in a flight..
@Jetblue  I will keep on tweeting until your CEO answers and personally apologizes to my wife and the passengers of flight 136. Just Wrong!!
@JetBlue I think it's safe to say that after 25 years of loyal #JetBlue flying we are officially DONE. #Byebyejetblue
"@JetBlue I have someone driving me, it's best to get a wheelchair once I get inside?"
@JetBlue finally! Finally!
"@JetBlue Token $75.00 Goodwill Voucher for passengers stuck on flight 136 from Phoenix today. 3 hour mark. How about a $27,000 per passenger"
@JetBlue anything serious I should worry about?
@JetBlue cool! Are there stairs at JFK? I can walk short distances but not stairs.
@JetBlue Think about it...boarding to a chill untz untz untz....like this http://t.co/lj2lARivE0...
@JetBlue Why are you making it so freaking hard for me to say good things about you??  #jetbluefail http://t.co/v8SB0RBICx
"@JetBlue Seriously, what is your solution? Who exactly will help my 5 year old if there's a problem with the plane? http://t.co/vPDRPLXj5a"
@JetBlue Your scheduling skills failed. The delay went from four hours to nearly six. Don't tell me you were snowbound in PBI.
@jetblue the man sitting next 2 me at the terminal has a scent tht i cant quite put my finger on. pls dnt let him sit by me on the flight.
"@JetBlue sadly, no! I have the app, but it also is experiencing difficulties. The flight information boards are keeping me updated."
@JetBlue This is absurd. Should a stranger help my kids if there's a problem? #jetblue http://t.co/LAiGgef9Kj
@JetBlue I have a disabled seat in row 6 do I get to board earlier?
"@JetBlue, thanks for not guarantee that you can not deli ever my bags to my hotel, when bag missed connection. #sFO #customerservicenot"
@JetBlue flight 2008
@JetBlue Pittsburgh
@JetBlue you're lucky we're still flying you after today's landing gear failure. Get your act together and help us sit with our kids!
@JetBlue so the prefference option is not something that you honor? So why having it as one of the services if not applied?
"@JetBlue if you want to be helpful, find us a seat. Don't quote terms and conditions. #jetbluefail"
@JetBlue do you REALLY think it's okay to sit kids away from parents?! Srsly?! Esp after your landing gear failure?? http://t.co/x6SYW3MDVu
"@JetBlue they absolutely guaranteed us we would sit with our kids. Your ""terms"" response is insulting.  #jetblue"
@JetBlue flight 1025 JFK to TPA 8:05am on Saturday! One way ticket!
@JetBlue What's your excuse this time for 1117 delay from LGA to TPA? I know the plane is in the air.
"@JetBlue if you can't guarantee parents will sit with their children, don't sell tickets with that promise! #jetblue http://t.co/HDoXiM6NZ2"
@JetBlue once you go blue you don't go back
@JetBlue why are there so many delays to north east cities?
@JetBlue kids fly. Don't hire people who don't care about them. This guy. #jetblue http://t.co/clvlhfgUZw
@JetBlue I shouldn't be made to feel like a criminal because I want to sit near my 5 year old on a flight. #jetblue http://t.co/qgtCao1J2U
"@JetBlue Usually I have such a great experience with you guys? Very, very unhappy with you right now."
@JetBlue why would you hire a guy who doesn't care about the safety of children? Not remotely acceptable. http://t.co/lKFh9HYHW8
"@JetBlue what's up? Three delays so far, resulting in over three hours of unnecessary, extra waiting."
"@JetBlue For the record, that was less than a 10-minute turnaround time for the answer from the question.  JetBlue rocks!"
@JetBlue never had an airline refuse to help sit parents with tiny kids. But this guy is willing to do it. #JetBlue http://t.co/MzZfGqfHu2
"@JetBlue from San Diego with a 4 hour delay to JFK!Even you have a Amex  JetBlue, even having over 50.000 travel miles, you're still nothing"
@JetBlue it seems almost inconceivable that sitting a 5 year old alone is considered okay. But this guy thinks so. http://t.co/q9n6NZYSpK
@JetBlue Third straight time that my flight has been delayed flying with you guys. This will be my last trip with you.
"@JetBlue you've let me down. 2:15 delay at JFK because of inbound flight from Syracuse, really? #ishouldhavedriven"
@JetBlue a 5 year old can't sit alone on a flight. This is absurd. And this guy is a dick. #jetblue http://t.co/2HXsDP0ha4
@JetBlue being told by this guy that he will not help us sit next to our 5 and 8 year old on the flight. #jetblue http://t.co/49FLbgzZkd
@JetBlue of my tray table is broken what do i do?
"@JetBlue Domestic.  To be clear -- I do not have to sit in (your lovely) terminal, just need to be there 1 hour prior to boarding?  Thanks!"
@JetBlue thanks for NOT! Sending me an update that our flight was delayed 3 hours. Unbelievable!
@JetBlue the fact that #ChrisHasMadeUsBLUSH isn't trending is how you know I'm loyal 
@JetBlue 5 hours delayed now in hour increments?  Really?  &amp
"@JetBlue no, I haven't done that yet. Is that something I can do online? Thx!"

@JetBlue Thank you for the reply. Would've appreciated communication before checking in about the delay. JetBlue used to be my go-to
@JetBlue What confirmation number?
@JetBlue You also promised to change my wife's name on the account and it is also not done.  WTF?
@JetBlue You guys really suck! I just spent 40 minutes on the phone linking my credits to my account.  They are still NOT there! 1/2
"@JetBlue btw, Robin Hayes is speaking at next month's @USChamber aviation summit. He ought to give a shout out to his Twitter team. You rock"
@JetBlue follow for DM please
@JetBlue oh. And thank you for responding
@JetBlue where is it coming from? I thought Tampa?
@JetBlue Good perspective. If only this safety concern had been expressed at some point before I arrived at the airport. #communicationiskey
@JetBlue exactly why is my flight delayed? 599 BDL to DCA? Can't seem to get an answer
@JetBlue thanks. We are ticketed on stand by for flight 1970. I hope we make it out. Fingers crossed

@JetBlue at what point in delays can I take a different flight to my destination?
@JetBlue thank you guys! You are the best! _٪Ή���
"@JetBlue You just don't get it.  It's not about the money, It's about PEOPLE!!!! How about a public apology from the president of Jet Blue."
"@JetBlue why, when you book a flight now, does jetblue separate a 3yr old from the mother? Isn't that a bit stupid? check-in headaches!"
@JetBlue does not fit in 140
@JetBlue love it as always!
"@JetBlue You never got my wife to her destination and you expect a $75.00 ""goodwill credit"" will  make everything hunky-dory. You blew it."
"@JetBlue every time I look at the flight status, 30 more minutes is added to the delay. How about some points for trouble??"
"As soon as I can, sending my son home with you Saturday. @JetBlue"

@JetBlue I usually do-but I didn't make the Flight Booking Problems this time-that'll teach me! Yea I have that going for me at least haha
@JetBlue I waited 3 hrs for my bags and my flight was only 2 hrs
@JetBlue should I bother contacting them? I already checked into my flight _��
@JetBlue early last month via Expedia-there's an extra middle name and initial attached to my last name
"@JetBlue backlog is an hour at most, this is over two!  Unacceptable!!"

@JetBlue I only fly Jet Blue
@JetBlue Perhaps you need to start recruiting @msbgu 
@JetBlue Start including PTO in your getaway packages and I'm all in
@JetBlue thanks. I will use the extra time to do some more shopping! Did somebody say duty free?
@JetBlue's flight Flight Booking Problems experience is pretty great!
@JetBlue still waiting to board and see if they will give us the exit row.
@JetBlue thanks for making my trip home #MintyFresh next #brandmance flight I'll take more selfies! #LOVE #travel #business
"@JetBlue  I shouldn't have to find them, they should tell us. I've flown Jet Blue since your first month. The experience isn't what it was."
@JetBlue if my flight was delayed can I show up at the airport with the appropriate amount of time for the delay or do I have to go on time?
@JetBlue I'm over that honestly just would like to get going on the journey.
"@JetBlue If that was the case, why did your alert arrive so Late Flight? Four-hour delay? Don't buy it."
@JetBlue our flight out no Tv. Now our flight back not seated together. B6 620. Maybe our fault still no fun.
@JetBlue I don't believe so. That's not what the team has told us.
@JetBlue also not have food available even for purchase is quite shocking since this is a 5 hour international flight.
@JetBlue #1691 out of JFK. no one has info &amp
@JetBlue I have a reservation for tomorrow morning but trying to get back 2 night bc other flight was going to jfk. Can I get on list at CTG
@jetblue  Flight 1562 is still waiting for bags. Most of us checked in 12 hours ago. People are missing connections.  Please help!
@JetBlue any way to get 2 ppl on standby list for flight 1970 FLL to BOS. Trying to find way home.
@JetBlue Something to think about when you are dealing with PEOPLE!!!!!  Just wrong.  No excuses. Figure it out &amp
@JetBlue I understand but wish you would have announced the delay 2 hours earlier vs sitting for 2 hrs at MCO
@JetBlue what gives? Delayed over 2 hours at MCO to JFK. Every time!
"���@JetBlue: @2littlebirds Well captured, Brittany! We love the clouds! :)  Enjoy the ride!�۝ Thank you!"
@JetBlue My wife was with our dog.  They wouldn't even let her out off the plane.  My daughter was at Newburgh lives close by. So wrong
"@JetBlue According to your ground staff, it hasn't even been taken off the plane yet!"
.@JetBlue thanks for making an effort. Credit where credit is due: flight 795 delayed 5 hours instead of 8 hours. #fwiw #loweredexpectations
@JetBlue At what time?  All these passengers were sitting on a hot plane with no air and no communication for over 2 hours. Just wrong
"@JetBlue flight delayed at JFK 2 hours, then 3 hours, then 8.5 hours? Now it's back to 5 hours with no explanation or apology?"
@JetBlue thanks! Have a good Sunday.

@JetBlue thanks for making my vacation not worth it again... Currently waiting on the runway for another hour to DEPLANE

"@JetBlue where is the ""award winning service""?"
@JetBlue really not acceptable. Just informed plane won't start. Chartering bus to take passengers to jfk.
@JetBlue how much longer to JFK open's I am a diabetic and I need sugar plane don't have nothing
@JetBlue flight 16 now sent back to the gate even though the app says its leaving. Anyone have a clue? It's 36 and sunny at JFK

@JetBlue what's the delay if the system isn't down?
@JetBlue  Not blaming Jet Blue.  This wasn't weather. Can't have planes in the air and runways a mess. That's a disaster waiting to happen.
@JetBlue don't think any1 rly knows what's goin on. supposed 2 leave at 8:30a then 9a then 9:30a then 10a then 11a then 11:30a. Now 12

@JetBlue do you do any discounts for volunteer firefighters?
"@JetBlue Well, I fly into Huntsville, AL. But I'd take either Nashville or Birmingham too!"
"@JetBlue If your confirming to me that the rate won't go down again looks like I can't fly JetBlue this time around, can't afford that price"

@JetBlue thanks
@JetBlue Then en route to the airport the rebooked ticket was refunded.

@USAirways well then that is a horrible flaw in your system. 2 hours in the past day I've wasted. I've got a job &amp
@USAirways 5203 and we're just sitting 20 feet from an open gate
@USAirways just wasted another hour of my life on hold. this is insanity. there has to be another way to use my voucher as payment online
@USAirways what's wrong with the plane? Flt 581
"@USAirways @united two broken airplanes, two days Late Flightr and I'm stranded after a funeral and missing out on my last semester of #college. _�ԍ"
@USAirways @AmericanAir Day 3 &amp
@USAirways Flight 830 CLT to Phl. I was 1st on list.Someone else got spot. Rude employee in coach. Wouldt give ID. Said he was cute red head
"@USAirways asked her why needed to take yellow tag off. She said, ""because I told you to!"" Expect a personal apology from her- unacceptable!"
"@USAirways , since jan 22 have been on 10 flights. Why the disrespect in CLT, flt #2063 at 2:50pm on 18feb to DCA? just asked herba question"
@USAirways nah it's for my flight next week.. inside my Chairman 7-day window but you still haven't released the last open First seat to me
@USAirways flight 1946 out of clt this morning.  It's snowing here.  Should i head out to the airport?
@USAirways I've been on hold for 41min. Just trying to change my reservation.
@USAirways I am a UK citizen. Is there a UK number I could try?
@USAirways I just spent 3.5 hours and got nowhere. Entire experience #epicfail
@USAirways Changing my flights with no explanations and still don't have a confirmation. So disappointed in the service
@USAirways nope not yet...
@usairways I will make sure to never use your incompetent airlines again. My luggage has been out for delivery for 24 hours.
"@usairways My flight was Cancelled Flighted Saturday. Why was my luggage not at the airport? Today, I'm supposed to have it delivered. Pathetic"
@usairways  Thank you for allowing me to spend more money on vacation by buying things I already bought.
@usairways Thanks so much for ruining my vacation. I really couldn't have done it without you.
@USAirways it's not like I'm trying to leave earlier just for fun. I don't want to get stuck in DC if we have bad weather in RDU.
@USAirways some flexibility on your part would be nice. This is why I love @SouthwestAir. They're flexible &amp
@USAirways Excited that I'll be flying from Syracuse to interview in Dallas on Friday for the FA position- this is a goal &amp
@USAirways thank you for reaching out to me. Hopefully my request will be fixed and I can remain a loyal customer.
@USAirways it doesn't take 6 days to respond to an already open case!
"@usairways great crew for flight 504 PHX to YVR tonight! Friendly, efficient. Awesome job."
@USAirways are people going to answer our calls?
@USAirways pilot forgets to show up to work and Ricky J (gate agent) gives customers attitude. #usairwaysfail
@USAirways : You Make the Reservation
@USAirways Thank You for your empathy there is more to this story than just the luggage but thank you for reaching out
@USAirways is utterly unreliable! They didn't schedule a pilot for their US624 flight out of Seattle - flights are delayed #usairwaysfail
@USAirways yes but again valuable time has been lost
@USAirways I don't like being lied to. No bad weather in dc md va. I've been stuck in CA all day and should've been home by now. You owe me.
@USAirways yes it landed at 11:40am. Should not take another 12+ hours to go 40 min drive. Was assured I would have this am.
@USAirways the disappointment was not the bag but that it arrived before me and I was kept 12 hrs without options in IAH
@USAirways can't get back lost time
@USAirways flt 1820 2rsw could have extended the courtsey of waiting 2min 4 10 of us.... gates closed in r faces.  Ur fired
@USAirways - thanks however I feel like the system has failed me -- what is the solution?
@USAirways my bag landed 1 day Late Flight at sfo at 11:40am. How can it be 10:01pm and I still don't have it? Flight 719 2/22/14
@USAirways thanks very much! I got thru on the phone &amp
"@USAirways thanks for nothing. Bought two tix through you to Disney and my friend can't go and now I have to eat the 400, plus 600 for new 1"
@USAirways Hi. I'm in LGA but my luggage is in CLT. Have been told to come back tomorrow to collect. Do you guys want to cover my taxi fare?
"@USAirways  Instead of fair treatment, I got a nasty letter from a lady in senior management that illness forfeits miles like death."
"@USAirways  A few years ago I lost over 50,000 miles bc I was physically unable to fly during the period.  I submitted a doctor's note."
@USAirways  I've never been treated this badly
@USAirways  I'm glad this airline is going to be swallowed by American!!! American always picks up the phone and solves problems.
@USAirways  Three months and my miles haven't been credited.  No one is going to read the email I sent.
@USAirways   My email gets me a canned response that it takes 10 days for mileage to get credited --- It's been three months and my miles
@USAirways  My tweet gets me a response to email dmsc@usairways.com
@USAirways The help/complaint forms on the website can be used only if the matter applies to an actual ticketed flight
@USAirways   No one picks up the phone all day/  no opportunity to leave a voicemail
"@USAirways  Instead, the miles are credited to an account that i did not open
-- My request to merge the accounts is denied"
@USAirways No I was there 12 hrs early! Send me an email to share my experience You don't want this blasting here.
"@USAirways  I open the credit card and earn 44,000+ miles, and you wont' credit the miles to my account to restore the forfeited miles"
@USAirways  you took the miles out of my account and told me that I could restore by paying $150 or opening a credit card
"@USAirways  - I had 20,748 miles in  my account and was informed I'd forfeit them bc of 33 months of inactivity - I"
@usairways - It's all automated and no one cares to understand the problem I'm having
@USAirways screwed me up big. 1st flight 1hr Late Flight. Made it to 2nd flight. CSM daryl wouldn't let me on the plane because we were (1/4)
"@USAirways Houston hub Aa T. Employee the bag is not here, It made it to Pa before me! Oops not your problem http://t.co/Uld0hWFkfo"
"@USAirways charged my card 11 times for one airline ticket, now card is on security hold"
@USAirways not yet. But we will see shortly.
@USAirways I've flown US Airways at least five times. Every single time has been like this. Actions speak louder than words.
@USAirways flight from Bhm delayed 5hrs! Connect flgt left us in clt at a motel
"@USAirways membership has no privileges anymore - my son is in the army, short window to see him - NO help."
@USAirways honestly - how is it quickly as possible I've been on hold sine 9:50pm? Everyone that answers has to send me to someone else.
@USAirways done it! Process initiated Saturday morning.  Can't get info with website issues &amp
@USAirways yay for glitchy tracking system!  My bags made it to my destination and not Laguardia like the app said!
@USAirways really???  NOT ONE OF THEM CAN BOOK DIVIDEND MILES TRAVEL - Literally on hold now since 9:50pm - it's 11:30pm #NoExcuses
"@USAirways yeah I know that but that doesn't get me my money back does it, everytime I fly with you something bad happens."
"BY THE GRACE OF GOD, I MADE IT! ���@USAirways: @__RWG__ We don't have those powers in here. We hope you can make that flight.�۝"
@USAirways Everyone is sorry.  Don't have what I need for meeting tomorrow.  140 charac. isn't nearly enough to highlight your shortcomings
@USAirways is the worst. I have to pay $200 just to NOT take my first flight in a round trip! Otherwise they'll Cancelled Flight my whole flight.
"@USAirways if it was so important, why did I wait on hold and then get hung up on by your computer?  #disappointed"
@USAirways thank u i wiil write after call  travel agency
@USAirways terrible service
"@USAirways Disgusted with your poor customer service. U wrongfully remove &gt; 65,000 miles from my Dividend Miles and no live person,"
@USAirways Please hold flight US 639 in Phoenix! I'm a weary traveler stuck on another flight because the tarmac is having issues!
"@USAirways - No live person to speak with all day at Dividend Miles, after they wrongfully took over 65,000 miles out of my account."
@USAirways my frustrations are the result of multiple experiences Late Flightly. Currently lost luggage. I want to talk to a real person.
"@USAirways cust svc means nothing! So disappointed. Trying since 730a to speak to a human I get bad weather not bad service.
#socialtantrum"
"@USAirways yes, but I had to pay more for another flight to get me out tomorrow since there weren't anymore for tonight...not fun :-/"
"@USAirways Well, that's a problem considering I need to book a flight tonight for this weekend... is there anything you can do?"

"@USAirways was transf, held 15-18 min more b4 agent answered and helped. By time I got to person fare I'd seen was gone.  Had to get supv."
@USAirways you are the actual worst.  You have zero respect for your passengers. I'm officially done flying with you.
@USAirways has the worst customer service line.  I've called them 8 times today and not once was I able to talk to a real human being.
@usairways that wasn't the issue. Someone finally helped on the phone. Now theres a website error that won't let me process my request. SMH
@USAirways you say to call travel agency and they say we cant refund because usairways didnt accept this.
@USAirways ... I f@$%ing hate you.
@USAirways travel agency said that if usairways accept we will refund money i dont understand why dont u refund
"@USAirways Yes &amp; have already spent 1K+ on the card &amp; paid the $89 annual fee, but the 50K miles have not shown up. Want to fly AUS --&gt; ATL"
@USAirways no i use to skyscanner and travel agency and i called u . You said you should call travel agency but
"@USAirways finally spoke with someone. I have to email the refund dept. I love you guys, but 6 hours in line to be told no dice sucks."
"@USAirways yes, with Delta!"
@USAirways well I thought they had hours ago but just found out that no I do not have a seat
"@USAirways : Was on flight 2046 BOS-CLT on 2/22, awful experience, exit row seat was so narrow that I could not move my legs! Unacceptable."
"@USAirways yes, but we were answered and put back on hold while they were to check on our request..  50 mins Late Flightr nothing!"
@USAirways   Not good. On hold for over an hour. http://t.co/wSgYckCIIO
@USAirways Expedia reserved a ticket for me and 2 more for a USAW flight but only issued 1. They are not responsive.Thoughts?
"@USAirways no worries, your flight attendant took care of it."
@USAirways Thanks for getting back to me. I called that number earlier but no option to leave vm and just rings with busy tone

@usairways I've been on hold for over an hour only b/c my CC miles aren't showing up. What a mediocre combo of cc &amp
@USAirways I am a premium #DividendMiles #cardholder. Unacceptable 4 you to #hangup my #customerservice call twice after putting me on hold.
@USAirways I bougth ticket same fligths twice and you dont refund money it is big problem other company refund money why dont u pay back
@USAirways @AmericanAir now this is beyond ridiculous. Some steering problem delays us again. #neveragain  it's no wonder you had to sell
"@USAirways hi, Im trying to speak with someone to book travel for a minor. The phone keeps disconnecting. Please advise. Website wont allow."
@USAirways did a pre schooler develop your app? The thing crashes every single time.
@USAirways and @FlyKnoxville - bad weather should not be an excuse for not following established luggage procedures. #NoClothesNoInfo
@USAirways On hold for going on 40 minutes after spending 10 hours delayed in Denver cause of a broken plane. Thanks guys.
@USAirways #FAILINGYOURCUSTOMER ONE BY ONE

@USAirways every single time i fly you guys i am delayed at least 30 minutes. Every time. On flight 5612 out of #CLT to nola.
@USAirways is it ok for a flight attendant to talk nasty about passengers while they go get drinks by the restroom? I was shocked listening
@USAirways good work by flight 1798 crew.  #Chairman's recognition even in coach.  Too many #missedupgrades Late Flightly.  What's up with this?
@USAirways changed our flight 6 times in 1 trip. Bumped to @Delta now &amp
@USAirways I can't wait to never fly with you again. Always delayed. Always lose my bag. Rudest people on the planet. Southwest is the best
@USAirways I sent email to customer.relations@aa.com. Will this work?
@USAirways sat on the ramp for 45 min and missed my connection. No one seems to concerned at usairways.
@USAirways It's very difficult to work with Baggage claims when they don't answer the phone
@USAirways I lost an ID on your plane and having trouble finding a contact for your lost and found in Cleveland Hopkins Airport. Please Help
@USAirways I have better Intel than she does!  She said plane is due in at 630.  Flightaware and your own app say 645
"@USAirways not likely, flightaware says plane is still in Durango and hasn't departed."
"Too little, too Late Flight. You suck RT @USAirways: @mitchsunderland Oh no, Mitchell. Our agents are happy to offer you available options."
@USAirways Hi-i have a travel question. Could you please follow me so i can dm you?
"@USAirways should, but didn�۪t."
@USAirways just now but no general announcement

@USAirways I�۪d suggest proper information dissemination to all staff on a more timely &amp
@USAirways i have been patient.. especially the first time. i will never fly with you again
@USAirways seriously? Every flight I have had the past 2 days has been delayed. Every single one. Terrible
@USAirways I just want to be heard and to discuss the many issues on my trip
@USAirways what's up with flight 5545 no gate agent or plane at PHX B18?  Nice customer service.
@USAirways very embarrassing.
@USAirways I�۪m still disappointed that it is apparently ok for a Flight Attendant who isn�۪t up on current policy to argue with a traveler.
@USAirways yes I know the industry procedure on baggage. Thanks for helping..... _��� what about the impossible connection that started this?
@USAirways I agree but per the captain this issue happened before boarding &amp
@USAirways and despite tailwind��_ Will still be Late Flight.
@USAirways 1500 characters are not enough to convey the issue. Was directed to emailmailto:customer.relations@usairways.com unmonitored. BAD
@USAirways Thanks! Sent you DM re: baggage issues.
"@USAirways i have and you have not been able to locate them, its insane. i trust you and PAY you to look after my things and you lost them."
@USAirways and yet the Flight Attendant argued with me over Exec Plat benefits...
@USAirways please stop asking me each week to place my bag in the size check #ITFITS http://t.co/AUrn07pWD4
@USAirways  has me on my toes whether I'm going to make my flight back to Boston tonight
@USAirways @AmericanAir need to check candy w working flight 449 iah to phx on usairways she is the reason I always choose @Delta #rude
@USAirways @AmericanAir explain how come I can get a free upgrade on US as an exe plat but not exit row seating w/out paying. confused
"@USAirways Yes, ground crew finally showed up so plane could depart very Late Flight."
"@USAirways #686 is delayed due to tail winds and need to jump on #521 to SEA, leaving the same time this arrives. Is there a chance to hold?"
@USAirways I have submitted my request. I would appreciate a call by 9am eastern. Thank you.
"@USAirways  I need to email customer service for help and a question, can you please provide the email address?"
@USAirways @VincesViews  there are significant number of folks on 686 connecting to 599 a few minutes hold would make many happy
@USAirways  can you help me out?
@USAirways is anything being done to make Flight Attendants aware of AA member benefits? Embarrassing being argued with. Just happened.
@USAirways i have a question. i need to talk to someone by email. Can you give me your email address? Thanks.
"@USAirways @Gregm528 well there is certainly nothing happening ""in front"" of the scenes. #Noaccountability  #disappointing"
@USAirways 4 hours on tarmac in Charleston and still can't get a response after a week. Unacceptable
@USAirways customer service at its best! Rachel S.  took great care of us at the PHX airport. http://t.co/HG7vEqhGHy
@usairways &amp
@USAirways  I will never fly us airways again.
@USAirways strikes again--Late Flight crew #3/4 for the trip and maintenance #2/4.  Worth the extra $200/trip for less hassle and fewer delays
"@USAirways Can you follow, so I can DM you?"
@USAirways so I get bumped to the 6pm to Birmingham which is now delayed because the pilots scheduled don't have enough hours together. Fail
"@USAirways yes, thanks but took forever"
@USAirways as far as being delayed goes��_ Looks like tailwinds are going to make up for it. Good news!
@USAirways horrible travel day w/ your airlines. My 2:20 flight to Birmingham was Cancelled Flightled w/ no notification so I couldn't get on the 4:05
"@USAirways I asked if that was SOP, and they said ���It is now.�۝ But yet the other 11 flights, nothing. Is this a policy or not?"
"@USAirways while I�۪m asking��_ 2 of my 11 non upgraded flights, Attendants came &amp; greeted me &amp; thanked me for my business b/c I was Exec Plat."
@USAirways 24 hrs of traveling and this just welcomes u back home to the US. 4 hr layover and I get to watch it going to wrong destination.
@USAirways it is really embarrassing when asking for complimentary drink/snack detailed here: https://t.co/9zA6xb1h89 &amp
@USAirways I am so disappointed with the service I received with you on my travels to NC these past few days .. you lost my baggage twice.
@USAirways but question :  if the downgrade include losing first class do you get money back ? http://t.co/LfT7QD23Sy
.@USAirways Have you just given up?
.@USAirways and then you said I could move my Thursday flight for free if I CALL A NUMBER. And then you HANG UP ON ME.
@USAirways Are you not even going to acknowledge that you bumped me from a flight (NOT BECAUSE OF WEATHER I AM IN ARIZONA)
"@USAirways Your ""moveup"" policy really sucks. United has a 24 hour policy for this with status. I was wanting to move up from 5am to 7am..."
Great management of @USAirways twitter account. Thank you.
@USAirways why is it impossible to change / buy preferred seats via your app?
@USAirways I am good. I just did not understand the terminology.  but the merger brings new verbiage
@USAirways can you priv chat to help chairman reroute

@USAirways can you help chairman? I am on flight 686 PHX connect 599 SJC will miss connection can you reroute please.
@USAirways your airway is a joke. I have never dealt with worse service
@USAirways great. I just called your fucking phone number and she hung up on me
@USAirways IT HAS BEEN FOUND THANK YOU
@USAirways @hhagerty that's a lie.
"@USAirways also, can you explain why, when I checked in, on the US Airways site, &amp; picked ""Standby for 1st"" I was not put on the list?"
@USAirways your customer service # has a recording that says we are to busy to assist and hangs up. Great touch. #poorservice @GMA @CBSNews
@USAirways your lack of customer service has shined. I need you to step up and get my lost baggage to delta. So they can return it to me.
"@USAirways do you operate ANY flights without maintenance issues? Flights in/out of DCA Cancelled Flighted, this is getting old. Update fleet pls!"
@USAirways And you took away my 1st class seat.  Love being a Chairman Preferred and assigned row 24 seat B middle seat
@USAirways patience is what my connecting flight will need. Why do you guys do this to me every time I travel? Every. Single. Time.
@USAirways PLANS CHANGED! IS THAT WHAT U CALL NOT BEIN ABLE 2 PARK ON TIME PLANES W A 2 HR LAYOVER N B ABLE 2 MAKE UR CONNECTION! #seriously
@USAirways I have a receipt but no conf # for a Thur flight. When I call for help I was literally hung up on b/c of wait times. Help!
@USAirways is it your practice to give 1st class seats to us air employees before giving them to chairmans customers sitting in coach?
@USAirways THANK YOU for resolving the issue. On direct flight to sfo from @united
@USAirways would help if you flew bigger planes into TLH. All my team mates made it to the training but me.
@USAirways ok thanks
@USAirways no I am trying to get on a plane from Phx to RNO and the gate is saying the flight was downgraded.
@USAirways She was put on hold on that number for a loooooong time too.  No help. #lostandforgotten
@USAirways I have never had a more unpleasant travel experience in my life. Now I might not get on my flight till tomorrow? This is insane
@USAirways direct flights to SFO leaving from same airport with @VirginAmerica and @united - can you please put me on one of those?
"@USAirways awesome... Doors close in 2 minutes, flight leaves in 17 minutes... And the plane just got here. WTH?"
@USAirways I'll check it out when I get to the airport. Thanks.
@USAirways ticket counter people here are not helping and just want to charge more money even after this horrible day.
@USAirways - HA! flight to CTL delayed! Going to miss connection. Can you please transfer me to another airline asap? http://t.co/1XdLbiBClP
"@USAirways thanks for the reply. On a good note, the pilot nailed the landing. Seriously. Kudos."
@USAirways on 5:55 flight to CTL to catch 8pm flight to sfo. But empty seats on 4:15 flight which wasn't offered.  Awful service continues.
@USAirways I have to fly back to Charlotte out of a different airport. You guys are not very flexible like other airlines.
"@USAirways I checked in ""Standby for 1st Class"" only to find I am ""not on the list"". This merger is a pain."
@USAirways 4 great flights with no delays! Thank you!
@USAirways been on hold for 45 minutes. Is there a better time to call? This is getting ridiculous
@USAirways Your exchange/credit policies are worthless and shadier than the White House. Dissatisfied to the nines right now.
@USAirways honest question - how is a 1-way ticket from Charlotte (your hub) to LAX (2nd biggest city in USA) almost $600?????
@USAirways  how does one downgrade a flight?
@USAirways I'm shutting my data off for the flight. I want some response by the time I land.  You have 2 hours.

@USAirways I need to speak with a customer service agent today between 5-8pm  I had an unfortunate incident of discrimination today.
@USAirways @CLTDouglas slowest baggage claim ever
@USAirways Don't blame it on weather. Rep at counter cost me entire day - not weather.  Printed Boarding Pass too Late Flight. #TakeResponsibility
@USAirways too Late Flight.
@USAirways delays due to refueling are out of your control? If that's true I never want to fly US Airways again
@USAirways @AmericanAir shout out to Diane at EYW for helping get us home today instead of tomorrow (even if a little Late Flight!)
@USAirways made it! Just! Huge relief - thanks for your help!
@USAirways how about now getting us the rest of our bags please? We only received 2 of 5. Can you help with that?
@usairways im trying to get my dads wheelchair and no one is answering at Dulles.we have tried to call back on.multiple times
"@USAirways It's 838. We boarded and we are waiting now to take off, hopefully."
"@USAirways - thanks, I hope so. Maybe you can put in a good word for me? ;-)"
@USAirways US 728/Feb 21. Arrive 7 hrs Late Flight
@USAirways you guys lost my luggage
@USAirways US 728/Feb 21 Kim Y says: leaving on 15 minutes once paperwork is done. Wheels up ~ 1.5 hours Late Flightr.
@USAirways US 728/Feb 21 Hour 6 on plane when US Airways representative Kim Y enters deteriorating picture. Unhelpful with no assurances.
"@USAirways @marvinatorsb thnk you for response,all flights were full, couldn't get out until tmrw, had to Cancelled Flight and go w/other airline"
@USAirways US 728/Feb 21. Ground power shorts again for the third time. Weary German passenger deplanes. Makes me jealous. Auf wiedersehen!
"@USAirways US 728. Refuel; we've sat for so long. Pilot announces where the truck is. ""Look, over there to the left!"" Actual announcement."
@USAirways thanks but the bags are only 10% of what went wrong. 22 hours from DCA to SAN when there were no weather issues is not acceptable
@USAirways @AmericanAir trying to chg ticket for staff member leaving org before she can fly.We're a nonprofit-can't you make an exception?
@USAirways How can I speak to a human? Need 2 find bag delayed 2/21. Website and 800 # are telling me 2 different things! Got hung up on 2x
@USAirways US 728. One water run of the planet's smallest water bottles. Applaud you looking out for the environment.
"@USAirways US 728. Nope, not getting off. 3 hours in the plane. 4 pilot announcements. One water run of the planet's smallest water bottles."
"@USAirways US 728 Wait, now a gate opened. Back we go. (Good, maybe we can get off.)"
"@USAirways US 728 Uh oh, no gate. Now truck will come to us."
"@USAirways US 728 returned to gate to get ""MEL"" sticker. Oh, look. We heard from pilot! No clue what an MEL sticker is. Anyone?"
@USAirways I spent an hour on the phone with them and got no where at all
"@USAirways US 728 then lost ground power three different times. Not only grounded endlessly; now without air, lights, entertainment."
"@USAirways US 728 pilot started the flight by announcing arrival into Gatwick, not Heathrow. Moments of concern for all aboard."
@USAirways US 728 stated their issues as: no one around to close said door. More strange. Now we're not hearing from pilot for long periods.
@USAirways Seat 8D on Flight 545 last night is the worst seat I've ever been in.  No leg room! #dividendsmember http://t.co/NUhpLNXRIq
@USAirways One of your workers was very rude with us. We can tell you in DM cuz it won't be any good publicity...
"@USAirways US 728 stated their issues as: plane not moving as cargo door open on plane. Umm, ok. A little strange."
@USAirways my flight is delayed so I missed my connecting flight. Stuck in Philadelphia over night and no hotel voucher? Thanks for nothing
@USAirways US 728 stated their issues as: kept plane on ground to allow connecting passengers from other flight to board. Fine. Understand.
"@USAirways can I speak to a human with some compassion? I wrote an email to discuss my experience and received a generic ""sorry"" email back"
"@USAirways take a look at 1715. All F seats filled, so someone upgraded their friend instead of following rules."
@USAirways back in line at terminal because phone guy couldn't help.  One person in front of me 20 min wait again? http://t.co/HQHdAD7fvK
@USAirways So you understand why I'm resorting to Twitter: No help available at  gate while this occurred or by phone afterward.
@USAirways going to miss my connection due to another tarmac delay - on US5268 then 4050 - need a flight home today please!
"@USAirways, I'm expecting 400% reimbursement for the unprofessional decisions with US728 on 21 Feb. Check your very full complaint box."
"@USAirways what's the deal with flight 5268 from DCA to PHL? We boarded on time, left the gate a few mins Late Flight and are now sat on Tarmac?"
@USAirways stranding a student trying to get to Birmingham in CLT overnight w/o any help.  You can do better than that.  @av_duffy
"@usairways really need help asap, so please make it quick. Thx."
@USAirways well that is not going to help. I'vebeen on hold over 3 hrs &amp
@usairways hi. You lost my father's wheelchair. Every time we call we just get voicemail. My dad needs it to go home. Please DM me.
"@USAirways 4 segments, 4/4 delayed. Gnv &gt; CTL . CTL &gt; JAN . JAN &gt; CTL . CTL &gt; GNV. My year off from flying with you guys was the way to go."
@USAirways is charging me $200 to NOT take my flight. Lol. That is the last time I fly with them.
@USAirways yes. It says bag is being delivered. The local number says Not Open. Asked main # for cust service got hung up on.
"@usairways Row 16, flight 634 today if you're looking for specifics! I can run to Home Depot for the WD40 you if you need."
@USAirways seriously buy some WD40 for A319 operating flight 634 from GEG to Phoenix. Every seat squeaks w every shift. Still on ground!
"@USAirways I would happily wait in the terminal near food, restrooms and non irritated passengers."
@USAirways why let passengers on board when there was an issue? Over an hour &amp
@USAirways anyone there to help? Still on hold...
@USAirways oh yay! Now gate agents decide not to deal with upgrade list and just bump up whoever is closest.
@USAirways site shows on-time but FlightAware site shows delayed. Trying to decide if I get out in this ice to catch FLT 456 to PHX.
@USAirways is the absolute worst airline. 13 women were inconvenienced due to maintenance issues. Stuck all over- no care given.
"@USAirways flights &amp; ""customer relations"" are extremely disappointing. Faced too many problems to type. apology=$25 towards a flight. A JOKE"
@USAirways sitting here in PHL with all of your rude Customer Service Agents!
@USAirways @AmericanAir - Can flight #415 get the paperwork inputted?? We should have taken off an hour .. #sittingontheplane #hungry
@USAirways now on hold with customer care.  Wonder if someone will pick up the phone before 5pm.
@USAirways when will FLT 445 get a gate at DEN? Over 20 minutes waiting with no information.
@USAirways lots of fun to be removed from top of a list and manually readded to the bottom thanks to club agents. Thanks a lot Asha at DCA.
@USAirways your delayed flight out of Wilmington made me miss my flight out of Charlotte. Figure out how to take off and arrive on time.
@USAirways Wow unbelievable how you treat your customers at Puerto Rico airport! _�ԍ
"@USAirways usually ""sorry"" doesn't involve moving people to middle seats and removing them from upgrade lists. Guess that's a club perk."
@USAirways don't worry. Used own initiative and arriving much earlier than you planned for me
@USAirways nice try at the gate making traveler after traveler put bags in the size guide because you oversold.  Sorry #minefits
"@USAirways horrible service, wrong plane arrived, many confirmed passengers could not get on flight we paid for due to lack of seats flight"
@USAirways trying to book award travel leaving on red-eye Sunday night after midnight. Should I book the date in Sunday or Monday?
"@USAirways booked flight 1mnth ago, seat CONFIRMED, small plane arrived and was not allowed to board bcs no seat, horrible service"
"@USAirways Very frustrated, checked bag in Logan, was not given a luggage ticket,now luggage is lost &amp; no ownership from @USAirways"
@USAirways They were breathing very heavily. but were super helpful. Thank you.
"@USAirways Aye, and nothing to do with an automated system which doesn't work properly. Anyway, got through to somebody..."
"@USAirways okay, great. Thank you!"
@USAirways now my rebooked connection is delayed.
@USAirways I am in meetings in California and have no luggage!!
@USAirways And the number your agent gave me to call says you are not open? And the main number goes to a computer saying it is delivered?
@USAirways any way to get your call center to answer for a OneWorld award? Whenever try system says too busy and disconnect or endless hold
@USAirways Why did you put my luggage on the plane after mine? Then not deliver it to me like you said? Now show the claim as closed online?
@USAirways takes my money at once but then requires 7 to 10 days to process a refund? Why does your auto attendant hang up? #usairwaysfail
@USAirways how long for a reply
@USAirways Bag policy says stroller OR car seat.  We need to bring 2 car seats and 1 stroller.  Should I just call for details?
@USAirways it was customer service like I have never seen before!  Kudos to your organization.
@USAirways Who intentionally buys a flight with a 10 hour layover?  And what kind of airline would charge $200 to fix it? Wow... #usairways
@USAirways how do I get a hold of customer service? I've called multiple times &amp
@USAirways is there a # or a time bracket I can call to fix this problem?I've been attempting to fix this contact information issue for days
@USAirways I called the number and they said no one is available to take my call...guys this is insane
.@USAirways Can't book a flight online or over the phone. Your customer service is usually great -- anything you can do to help?
"@USAirways / @AmericanAir was the worst experience I've ever had flying. Rude, delays, Cancelled Flightlations, lack of updates, and wasting our time"
"@USAirways contact via FB messages, Twitter DM or text?"
@USAirways called 3x &amp
@USAirways @jhughes1025 grrrrrrrr. Couldn't book a flight via calling either :(
"@USAirways delayed, connection missed, now extended layover how about a lounge pass for PHL. #5077"
"@USAirways Another twist in the plot. Took off from Miami, then had to return due to a unsecured cargo door. most stressful vacation ever."
@USAirways she will be reaching out to you! HARDWORKING mom just trying to do her best!
"@USAirways great operation you guys are running. More mechanical issues, and now taping piece of plane together LOL http://t.co/I5V9wfbtuE"
@USAirways thanks! Any idea when it will be resolved? I'd like to purchase my ticket!
"@USAirways Hi, can you attach my AA FF# 94LXA62 to reservation E2KVM4. Thansk!"
@USAirways When I check online it states status closed. What does this mean? As I have yet been able to reach a live person...
@USAirways Your system is affected by the weather?
@USAirways we called and were able to get rescheduled. Thank you for the quick responses today!!
@USAirways how do you get your aa frequent flyer number to appear in a USAir reservation?? Frustrating
@USAirways I'm unable to check in for flight 2119 BOS-DCA and haven't heard if flight was Cancelled Flighted/rescheduled. Any updates??
@USAirways / @AmericanAir don't forget without your customers you would be out of business! #epicfail #usairwaysfail
@USAirways Hi guys! Are flights 5594 and 3937 still on time? The site and app are both down and I can't check. Thanks!
@USAirways @AmericanAir hey since you    f*%#ed my wknd can I have day pass to admirals club or meal coupon or free coke? {blank stare}
@USAirways : You Make the Reservation
"@USAirways I listed my baggage claim number.  Have them call me, my number is on the ticket.  I had to use Lady Speed Stick this morning."
@USAirways Another dead end.  They only handle AA L&amp

@USAirways We have submitted the customer relations form and await your response!
"@USAirways That is the height of rudeness, and without question the worst customer service I have ever experienced."
@USAirways I NEED TO *SPEAK* TO SOMEBODY ABOUT A RESERVATION. As in talk to a human being. Yet your computer system puts the phone down on
@USAirways Will you pick up your phone then?
@USAirways : Premier provider of missed connections! #usairwaysfail
"@USAirways I'm sure the people are working very hard, but the systems should assist with IVR prompting, offering call backs, hold wait times"
@USAirways thanks for a subpar travel experience and it's not even over yet #stepitup
@USAirways FYI your customer service rep Carol is an absolute delight. So pleasant to with with and rebooked me in lightning speed! Thanks!
"@USAirways is struggling. had me on hold for 25 minutes, kicked me back to the start, then said they couldnt handle the amount of calls"

@USAirways i will be Cancelled Flighting my us airways credit card and choosing other airlines after my experience this week.
"@USAirways thank you, but it says the website is down"
"@USAirways I cant make it to airport, roads are to bad in DFW and no one is answering the phones and the website is down?How do I reschedule"
@USAirways Pilot pleads to let boarding begin for full flight #1937 while waiting for 4th flight attendant. Denied by mission control. Grrrr
@USAirways website isnt working and I cant talk to any1 on the phone to check flight status out of dfw. Roads are awful and cant get there
@USAirways rebooked for Tuesday. Arriving too Late Flight for on Tuesday to start the class. Cancelled Flightled the trip.

"@USAirways thanx but this isn't my first rodeo. Done &amp; done yesterday. No results or comm, unless u count status: bags lost &amp; claim filed."
@USAirways @acnewsguy can you give me a # for US Air in philly to talk to a real person? Acarl4@hotmail.com
@USAirways would have been nice to be offered in flight credit. Especially since I'm staring at empty overhead room.
@USAirways or how about power outlets at your seat if you're gonna keep us siting here forever?
@USAirways I would appreciate a call regarding a HORRIBLE experience I had with a gate agent. Was on hold for 39 min and then hung on me.
"@USAirways I understand that, and when I'm attempting to change the information so they are identical, it tells me to call a #"
@USAirways What is going on with flight 1826 from PHL to PHX? 10 mins to estimated departure nobody has board and no update.

@USAirways no my flight plans have been delayed until tuesday due to your computer crash
@USAirways 4914 from PHL to BGM. I cannot believe this has happened 2x in under two weeks!
"@USAirways @AmericanAir ""ma'am the doors close 10 mins prior to departure"" ""but I was here 20 mins before?!?"" laughter from the 2 agents"
"@USAirways @AmericanAir at 9:05am after the plane left: ""why were there no agents and why were the doors closed so early?"""
@USAirways I called more than 25 times to redeem mile points and can't get through.  You advertise the miles but make them very hard to use!
"@USAirways @AmericanAir me after arriving at 8:41am for a flight scheduled to depart at 8:57am. doors closed, no agents"

@USAirways getting extremely frustrated w/ the phone/online service for merging frequent flyer miles.
@USAirways already spent 60 mins today handling this for my minor child. Shame on you for treating a 15 year old girl like this.
@USAirways @AmericanAir can someone help me with some travel issues today?
"@USAirways First the pilot was Late Flight, now it's maintenance. This is EXACTLY what happened two weeks ago. Unacceptable."
"@USAirways There is nothing on my USAir CC at this point, but the email stated I would be charged.  Thanks for the reply."
@USAirways I will NEVER fly us airways or american again and I will share this nightmare of a story to all the many others we know who fly
"@USAirways i have never been treated so poorly by an airline in my life, as a military family we do alot of flying.."
@USAirways @AmericanAir - Burned a lot of time and cell minutes working through this flight issue - hopefully we fly home in the morning.
@USAirways you would rather a while plane get exposed to a nasty contagious virus then work wth me to get my flight changed to a Late Flightr date
@USAirways &amp
@USAirways i worked with you and bought my own rental car when you failed to get me to the location i paid to get to and now....

@USAirways will all flights out of DFW be Cancelled Flightled today?
@USAirways can you add my KTN to an existing reservation?
@USAirways please fix the very unproductive check in process at @DCA. 20 check in stations and 2 people working them. What a total mess!!!!
@USAirways I will. Is it down or is just me?
@USAirways I'm supposed to fly through Dallas. Can you help me get a new itinerary?
@USAirways Your CLT baggage crew deserves a #kudos. I had to run to make my connection. And my bags still made it! #CustomerService
@USAirways Thanks!
@USAirways you denied a mom her AM flight because she NEEDED her breast pumping parts on a full flight? Please FIX this ASAP!! #freeflight
"@USAirways: I relied on US Airways, and that was my mistake. Awful customer experience."

"That's not the case.. They sent me a email with a link, I'll show you.. @USAirways http://t.co/hb799CCo0t"
@usairways Why are we waiting 40 min so far for our luggage??? #wannagohome
@USAirways the only time I tweet is to tell you how horrible you're attendants are. Flight 3841 to LGA. I feel in jail
@USAirways hello??? Anyone there?

@USAirways then she had to get her own hotel so ur agents did nothing to help and to top it off you sent her luggage on the wrong flight!!!
"@USAirways so she has to take a Late Flightr flight booked by her corporate (Disney) travel dept, as your agent offered little help"
@USAirways your computer system went down ok that is understandable but the agents make it worse by not helping her or anyone else
"@USAirways as the employee responsible for social media content, yes u probably do care however the actions from last night say otherwise"
@USAirways Flight gets in 30 minutes early and all goodwill gone when bags aren't here 45 minutes Late Flightr
"@USAirways. wow, awful customer service."
@USAirways merging with American will negatively affect your quality and integrity. I will no longer fly with you because of it.
@USAirways How many agents do you have working to handle the thousands of calls?
@USAirways YOU ARE THE BEST!!! YOU ARE AMAZING!!! FOLLOW ME PLEASE
@USAirways flight 435 is delayed so will miss connecting flight 457 can you please help with alternate? Thank you.
"@USAirways 4469, thank you for asking."
@USAirways three hour wait and counting waiting for reservations on the phone. Are you serious!?
@USAirways on a happy note our 719 crew is wonderful. Can't say enough great things about our pilot. He's doing all he can for us.
@USAirways What a mess caused by the computer systems. Flight 719 in 3 hours Late Flight and now no gate for us. Est 26 min wait.
"@USAirways Storm or no storm, your customer service is a joke. 6 hour wait time to speak to someone? I will never fly your airline again."
@USAirways you guys have my luggage in San Jose and were supposed to deliver it to my hotel hours ago!! Please contact me.
@USAirways I've flown 6 figured worth of miles in my lifetime.  This was my first and last ever flight on US Airways
@USAirways pls get me back to Tallahassee:( no one should ever have to be stranded in Gainesville for this long_���
@USAirways your a miserable airline and your loss of revenue is a reflection of that.  Go extinct.  A merger only delays the inevitable
@USAirways What was the point of the merger?  Why not just go out of business if your not turning a profit anymore?
@USAirways I love how just to give feedback to this link I have to fill out all my personal info on a form.  You guys are the best :)
@USAirways Finally got ahold of an Agent after another hour. Thanks for the follow up.  Recommend a call back feature.
@USAirways IS THIS RINGLING BROTHERS BARNUM AND BAILEY???  SHOULD I KEEP MY EYES PEELED FOR THE CLOWN CAR???
@USAirways not to mention the fact that my flight was delayed BECAUSE YOUR COMPUTERS WERE DOWN
@USAirways cannot add my frequent flyer number on your website.  Can you help?
@USAirways how do I get off my plane and wait over an hour and a half to speak to someone about reFlight Booking Problems?
"@USAirways Please don't trivialize me.  This is a joke, not a slow day or slow experience"
@USAirways And how do you only have 1 agent at PHX customer service desk when an hour ago the line was over 100 people long?
@USAirways sorry doesn't help.  It's midnight PST.  How in the hell am I still on hold after 90 minutes on customer service line?
@USAirways Like I thought this was America.  When did US Airways start operating under the rules of communist Russia?
@USAirways you guys should be nice and just give your routes to jet blue and southwest.  At least they treat their customers properly.
@USAirways But nope!  Apparently this is the way you guys do business!  I guess I'm flying southwest and her blue from now on.
@USAirways I keep thinking this is a massive practical joke and someone is gonna appear out of thin air and take me to Reno tonight.
@USAirways there's over 50 people in line and only one agent!
"@USAirways And by the way, I'm planning it while I've Ben waiting in the line at customer service in PHX...for over an hour!"
"@USAirways Already planning my local boycott for Washington, D.C. Area."
@USAirways I can legitimately say that I would have rather driven cross country than flown on US Airways.
@USAirways and despite the fact I see you answering all these people on twitter with mundane qs you refuse to answer me!
"@USAirways you guys are the worst airline I've ever dealt with.  No notifications, no keeping customers updated.  Terrible service"
@USAirways hey guys!  Thanks for answering me and thanks for keeping me on hold for an hour on customer service at 12 pm PST!
"@USAirways @PDQuigley any progress? Good luck, Patrick!"
"@USAirways @landonschott he's fine, he really likes picking his own seat...."
@USAirways is the worst airline to ever travel with.
"@USAirways has to be the most lazy, inconsiderate, and unprofessional airline that I have ever traveled."
@USAirways Do you have any pride in your service? Any concerns for my wife and everyone else on that flight? Or you just don't care????!!!
@USAirways now U horrible people say you have no where for her to sleep?
@USAirways who's in charge of your company? My wife missed her connection to CA you sent her luggage on another flight
@USAirways the call hung up on me..

@USAirways this says it was estimated to leave an hour ago (it hasn't left yet) so thanks for this useful information. #TheWorstAirline
@USAirways your customer service is horrendous. Between the way employees speak customers and their lack of care for problems with flights.
@USAirways had mom sit for 3 hours waiting for a flight they ultimately Cancelled Flighted to give her a Tuesday morning flight...no compensation. Ugh
@USAirways does anyone from your airline know how to do their job?

@USAirways has the WORST customer service and their flights are always delayed
@USAirways if you are going to make me wait in the phone for a long time can you at least turn off the ads they are eating away at my soul
"@USAirways despite mechanical issues and many delays followed by a Cancelled Flightlation, still getting to Vegas thanks to great gate agents!"
@USAirways US Airlines 699 LA to RDU is holding onto baggages for an hour already and everyone is still waiting!?
@USAirways we've now learned to never fly with u again. You've lost 16 customers from our group + the hundreds more from our company
@USAirways spoke with your reps in NH and PA. Very poor communications. Bags still sitting in Philly. TRAIN YOUR STAFF
@USAirways thanks for the worst customer service on the face of the earth. I loved the 5+ hrs on hold along w 2 Cancelled Flightled flights
@USAirways I tried reaching out to you guys I'm running out time and patience I just want my flight to be honor and I want a confirmation!
@USAirways Do you have Bereavement discount on airfare as my grandfather just passed and need to attend his funeral this week.
@USAirways and after six hours even the gate agent got fed up and left us all on line in front of an empty desk. Stay classy US Air.
@USAirways how do you lose a pilot????
@USAirways the ads on your phone systems when waiting for a rep is the most annoying thing ever especially when waiting for over 10 mins...
@USAirways @AmericanAir we are missing our connection due to delay out of LAS. What are we supposed to do now?
@USAirways #695 might have been Cancelled Flighted? mechanical issue. 6 hours Late Flightr 100 people still waiting and Zero information. Please send help.
"@USAirways 6 hours, no agent. Should I keep waiting?"
@USAirways how hard is it to unload bags in order of arrival? 45 mins and counting for flight 699
"@USAirways is it policy to tell customers ""We can't help you?"" I'm sorry but this is unacceptable"
@USAirways thank you for correctly interpreting my last tweet as non sarcastic and delaying my flight again. YYZ Terminal 3 dance party?
"@USAirways ""We can't help you. We don't put people up in hotels when you miss a flight it's against policy."""
"@USAirways my friends at KPHL were told by your rep ""if it were me I woulda just gone home this am and tried again tomorrow."" 1/2"
@USAirways Ann Marie at LGA is the best ticket agent ever! #excellentcustomerservice
